      "I have always been drawn to understanding systems.",
      "When I was young I wanted to understand space. The more I learned the bigger the questions got. I ended up studying cosmology; and learned and researched and [published](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=7yf2vEEAAAAJ&hl=en). I pushed the boundaries, learned the power of data and generalisation, and was ready to discover something new. I found myself [in tech](https://github.com/jimCresswell), and from there fell in love with the open web.",
      "Later I was drawn to more immediate concerns: climate breakdown, ecological collapse, social equity. Not as separate issues, but visible surfaces of an unbalanced network with shared levers for the joyful recovery of the living world.",
      "Emergent effects, stability through variety, self‑regulation through positive and negative feedback: dynamic systems continue to fascinate me. Ecosystems, social structures, open knowledge/software/standards: they are resilient through diversity, most adaptive under minimal interference: responsive to influence, not control.",
      "I stay close to work that changes contexts and so outcomes; not tuning systems, but allowing them to evolve into something new and dynamically stable. First‑order effects are visible, third‑order effects carry _impact_.",
      "That work can only happen collaboratively, and I am always excited to discuss where others see the levers.",
      "I have taught maths and physics, enjoy independent [research projects](https://web.archive.org/web/20211114073948/https:/www.obaith.com/), have volunteered in a community market garden and urban rewilding schemes, and have run for local government; I breed sunflowers at my allotment.",
      "I am currently exploring how to responsibly apply AI for [public benefit](https://www.thenational.academy). The more I learn, the bigger the questions get.",
      "My [CV is available here](/cv/)."
