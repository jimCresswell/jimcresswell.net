      "I work on high-impact, long-term problems, typically in early or unstructured contexts where neither the problem nor the path forward is yet clear. I lead exploratory work with a clear purpose: to surface the underlying structure of complex systems so that meaningful decisions can be made. I determine when exploration has done its job — reframing problems, committing, constraining options, and setting direction in ways that shape outcomes long after the initial work.",
      "My background spans physics, software engineering, and digital-first public services, but my centre of gravity is disciplined exploration and creation. I'm strongest in zero-to-one phases: forming new conceptual frameworks, giving initial shape to ideas that do not yet have an obvious operational form, and holding responsibility for shaping them into something real that others can build on. Often the work is not improving the current system, but deciding when the existing system is the wrong context, and shaping a viable alternative. In my work, discovery is a method for critical analysis, clear judgement, and holding a vision of the path forward for others to carry.",
      "My work is driven by working with large-scale systems to change the constraints and default paths that shape what happens next — creating viable alternatives over the long term by shifting the context and constraints in which others act and build, to create impact that persists beyond my involvement."

      "summary": [
        "At [Oak National Academy](https://www.oaknational.org.uk/), I lead on complex, high-impact problems by setting foundational technical direction inside a live national public service, enabling durable, ethical, and high-impact solutions to emerge. My responsibility sits in early and unstructured contexts where problem spaces are not yet defined, and decisions about what should and should not be built have direct consequences for teachers' workload, educational quality, and pupil safeguarding.",
        "At a critical point, I argued for a deeper intervention to address structural delivery risk that was compounding over time, and stood behind that decision as it was taken forward. Change complexity was increasing non-linearly, delivery pace was slowing, and meaningful innovation was becoming increasingly constrained. Rather than pursuing incremental optimisation, I backed a rebuild, accepting and managing near-term delivery and reputational risk to avoid a later, higher-cost failure under significantly greater delivery pressure. Four years on, the platform continues to sustain active development and innovation.",
        "More recently, my work has focused on treating Oak's openly licensed [curriculum data](https://open-api.thenational.academy/) as public digital infrastructure rather than a product destination. This has included exposing it through MCP tools, hybrid semantic search, and a clear SDK, so high-quality curriculum materials can be accessed where teachers and developers already work, including AI-mediated environments. The intent is deliberately indirect, reflecting organisational constraints and long-term leverage considerations: to preserve optionality, lower the cost of access to trusted public data, and enable others to build tools and practices over time. Across Oak, I have held responsibility for early judgements whose consequences persist long after the initial decision."

At HP Labs I automated manual testing processes and taught others to use the same systems, changing practice by changing context.",
