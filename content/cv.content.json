      "I'm drawn to problems that don't have shape yet — in digital‑first public services, AI‑mediated access to trusted knowledge, community‑driven systems change, and the structure of the early Universe. My work is to find the underlying structure: the frame that turns ambiguity into something that can be confidently delivered against. Shaping the problem is my creative act.",
      "My background spans digital product creation, software engineering, research, and building national‑scale public services — the common thread is origination: zero‑to‑one work, before problems have operational form. I set direction early, decide what should and should not be built, and hold that so others can build with confidence. Part of the work is recognising when the existing system is the wrong starting point and shaping what replaces it. The impact I care about is long‑term and structural: changing constraints in large‑scale systems so that the natural paths lead to different, better outcomes, lasting far beyond my direct involvement."

        "At [Oak National Academy](https://www.oaknational.org.uk/), I lead on complex, high‑impact problems by setting foundational technical and product direction inside a live national public service, giving teams a clear frame to build against with confidence. Over five years, I have helped shape the Engineering function from four contractors into five product squads and three platform groups — designing structure, coaching engineers, and translating technical options for non‑technical leadership. My responsibility sits in early and unstructured contexts where problem spaces are not yet defined, and decisions about what should and should not be built have direct consequences for teachers' workload, educational quality, and pupil safeguarding.",
        "At a critical point, I argued for a deeper intervention to address structural delivery risk that was compounding over time, and stood behind that decision as it was taken forward. Change complexity was increasing non‑linearly, delivery pace was slowing, and meaningful innovation was becoming increasingly constrained. Rather than pursuing incremental optimisation, I backed a rebuild, accepting and managing near‑term delivery and reputational risk to avoid a later, higher‑cost failure under significantly greater delivery pressure. Four years on, the platform continues to sustain active development and innovation.",
        "More recently, I conceived and built an SDK and MCP server for Oak's fully sequenced, pedagogically rigorous [curriculum data](https://open-api.thenational.academy/), released under the Open Government Licence and now directly accessible to AI‑powered services on the open web. Teachers are already using AI to reduce their workloads; edtech developers are already building in this space. Reliable access to trusted curriculum material at this quality lowers the cost of innovation for everyone — the lasting impact is in what others will build. The live challenge is product safety: ensuring AI services that consume this data are reliable, accurate, and safe."
