# Owner-Signal Interpretation

Interpretation heuristics for reading owner direction — the channel
semantics between owner and agent. Load when weighing whether an owner
turn is a grant, a gate, a supersession, or thinking aloud. The
load-bearing defaults live in
[`user-collaboration.md`](../../directives/user-collaboration.md)
§Working Model; this surface carries the depth — the tells, the modes,
and the worked corrections behind them.

## A Hedged Owner Statement Is Not Execution Authorisation

A tentative or first-person phrasing — "I think 1 and 3 this session",
"start with a discovery run", "it will do for now" — is the owner thinking
aloud or agreeing a direction, not issuing an imperative. Reading a hedge as
a grant over-scopes in-session work and can block peers; agreeing a *mode*
is a design decision, not an execution grant, and any standing constraint
(read-only posture, a gate, a claim boundary) still gates the real action.
When the hedge matters, confirm the grant before acting on it — the
smoothness of the "they told me to" frame is itself the fluency tell
([`metacognition.md`](../../directives/metacognition.md) §Fluency Is a
Warning). And an assent scopes to the deliverable named, never to the
side-artefacts an offer bundled with it: a "yes, please create a sketch"
was read as covering the offer's earlier "with a ticket to anchor it"
clause, and the owner corrected the unrequested write on an owner-facing
surface (2026-08-05). When an offer bundles a write on an owner surface
with a main deliverable, ask for the write separately or omit it.

## A Demonstrated Action Is a Directive

The inverse also holds. When the owner has acted in their own edits —
removed a masking override, deleted a file, chosen a shape — the
demonstration carries their intent as authoritatively as a stated
instruction; do not reverse it through lens-resolution or "proportionate
scope" reasoning, and weight an implementer's proposal that aligns with the
demonstrated principle over a conservative alternative that undoes it.

## Direction Is a Stream — Supersession, Extension, Re-Deliberation

Owner direction is a stream where the latest turn is authoritative about
its own scope, never a snapshot to freeze into a standing gate. Three
worked modes:

- **An earlier "wait" does not survive a later "drive."** One session
  (2026-06-14) froze an early "stick to prep / say go" into a standing
  permission gate and kept applying it after a retirement, a partner-add,
  and an explicit "you're driving" had each dissolved it — the
  team-visibility surface went dark while the agent idled. The tell is
  unmistakable: waiting for permission to do the thing you were just put
  in charge of IS the error. Re-read the latest owner turn before invoking
  an earlier gate; as the named driver, gate only what is genuinely
  owner-gated (an atomic untrack commit, a merge) and drive everything
  else.
- **The stream also supersedes your own re-deliberation.** The inverse of
  freezing an old direction is re-opening a *just-given* one: after a clear
  "drive it" / "commit them all", re-weighing the decision ("but should I
  really…") burns context and reads as indecision (owner correction
  2026-06-27, "let's get back to careful, direct engineering and merging").
  Once a directive is given, execute it with care — run the gate, read
  failures, fix — and reserve questions for genuine owner decisions. A
  decided directive arriving back as a question means the answer is
  already given.
- **Supersession is not the only mode — a turn can EXTEND.** One session
  (2026-06-28) inferred a "shallow-scan next" instruction *superseded* the
  in-flight brief; the owner corrected — no supersession, it ADDED a
  downstream goal. Before reshaping work around a new turn, distinguish
  supersession (replaces) from sequencing/addition (adds a later goal,
  leaving the current one live). Reading every new turn as a replacement
  wrongly discards a still-live earlier directive.
- **The stream can arrive by RELAY.** An owner ruling put-and-answered in a
  parallel seat's session can reach you as a directed comms event: treat a
  SPECIFIC, provenance-carrying relay sent under owner grant as owner
  direction — record the relay provenance in any artefact it shapes (cite
  the directed event), and re-true your own fresh prose the moment the
  relayed ruling supersedes it (worked instance 2026-07-08: four rulings
  relayed mid-session, including one that flipped a register row written as
  pending minutes earlier). This composes with `precedence-is-not-approval`:
  the relay must carry provenance and grant; a vague second-hand "the owner
  said" remains a claim to verify.

## A Binary Owner Rule Is Executed Literally

When the owner states a disposition rule in binary form — "if it is relevant
to X it stays, everything else moves or is closed, I don't want any pointers"
(2026-09-02, over twelve open PRs) — the rule IS the value judgement, and the
seat's job is execution plus the genuine blockers. A reflection that widened
the ask ("relevance is not value", "these are live merge legs", "moving
creates orphans" — each true in the estate's own doctrine, none what he
asked) drew "wow, that's a lot of assumptions that are not what I said", and
keeping a branch he had ruled worthless drew "I thought we were closing 918
because it was worthless, why would we keep it?". The shape: (1) restate the
rule in his terms in one line; (2) list the members of each class; (3) name
only hard blockers — credentials, access, a peer's LIVE claim on the exact
object; (4) execute. Reflection instruments invoked on a stated rule check
the EXECUTION shape (order, safety, verification), never re-derive the rule;
deleting a branch the owner ruled worthless is not removing work, and "a
pointer" includes a branch nobody wants.

Recorded frames in old plans, tickets and consultation records are the same
class the other way round: they are evidence of what was decided at their
write time, never authority over what matters now (owner, 2026-07-27: "prior
statements are not invariants, priorities, needs, and positions change,
don't treat statements in old plans as authority", after a pillar had been
paced off recorded gates while his current word was "soon"). Cite a recorded
frame as context with its date, then price the work from the owner's most
recent word; a recorded boundary that would slow something the owner just
asked for yields and gets re-trued, never obeyed.

Where a binary rule moves work out of the repository, "the destination of moved work is the owner's
business" and is not recorded on the estate's surfaces (a seat's standing reading of the owner's
words, 2026-09-02, event 2b31497e).

## Direction Scope Is Session-Bounded by Default

A direction the owner gives within a session applies to that session only;
it does not become standing unless the owner says so ("from now on",
"always", "this is a standing direction"). The founding miss: one session's
"I want to deal with fitness in a separate session" was extended into a
standing deferral across multiple later consolidation passes — the owner
corrected that the direction was scoped to its one session. Apply it as:

- When a prior session's handoff or continuity entry cites a direction, do
  not assume it carries forward — check whether the owner has restated it,
  or pose the question.
- A direction recurring across sessions in identical form is evidence of a
  *de facto* standing rule worth surfacing for explicit graduation, never a
  licence to assume it on your own authority.
- This applies to all owner-directed deferrals — fitness work, Practice
  Core edits, plan promotions, doctrine graduations. Each session decides
  afresh unless the owner says otherwise.
- When a direction's scope is unclear, the default move is: analyse the
  work the direction was avoiding, report findings, flag for feedback.

Scope (this section) and supersession (the stream above) are orthogonal
axes: one governs whether a direction is still live across sessions, the
other governs which turn wins within the stream.

## Owner-Attributed Text Carries Only the Owner's Words

An owner-attributed row, clause or ruling carries the owner's words
verbatim, or a seat-reading mark, and nothing in between. Inference wearing
verbatim clothing is the attribution-drift class, and its signature is a
correction cascade: a rule that keeps shrinking under successive corrections
(full prohibition → may share → coincidence → void from birth) was never the
owner's rule — the founding inscription was a seat's reading. Trace
provenance at the FIRST correction, never the third. Three instances: a PR
heading of 2026-08-14 that stated as an owner rule what the seat had
inferred; the design lane's "narrow sameness" ruling of 2026-08-13, which
three corrections shrank to void by 2026-08-17 (the cure recorded that day:
every owner-attributed clause carries a verbatim quote or a seat-reading
mark); and the design plan's R16 gloss, narrowed at PR #41's seventh round
on 2026-09-05 to the owner's verbatim with the multi-tenant reading labelled
a seat reading. The mechanical form — every owner-attributed clause carries
a quotation or a mark — is a validator candidate for the rulings tables.
An owner sentence is quoted whole or not at all: a spliced quote changed
the owner's subject (2026-09-25), and a copied quote drifts ("throughput"
written 26 times for the owner's typed "throughout", 2026-09-29), so quote
from the transcript or the first record, never from a later copy.

The scope corollary sits with §Direction Scope above: the bound of a
direction is the SITUATION it addressed, which can be narrower than the
session. A quota limit set for one day's situation was refused when a later
session re-applied it (owner, 2026-08-14, verbatim: "drop the quota limit,
that applied to a specific situation on a different day"), and a routing
fact spoken inside one support arrangement did not become a standing
assignment (2026-09-02). Ask what situation a direction served before
carrying it into another.

## An Answer Carries Directives Beyond Its Question

The owner treats the answer channel of a structured question as a general
instruction channel. An artefact-deletion confirmation came back as "delete
all three, and pass the seat to Barnacle" — the second clause initiated a
full Director-seat succession no question had asked about; another answer
the same day (2026-07-14) replaced a yes/no with a new question ("there
shouldn't be any worktrees... do we have potentially orphaned work?") and
redirected the whole task. Reading only the option label loses owner
directives at exactly the moments the owner chooses to steer. After every
structured-question result, parse the full answer text as if it were a fresh
chat message; extract and act on, or explicitly sequence, every clause beyond
the option selected.

## Colleagues Run on Trust, Never Pursuit

The working culture is trust between colleagues. When offered status-check
comments @-mentioning a colleague whose fix gated the week's work, the owner
answered (2026-07-29): "No one is chasing anyone, we respect each other. He
will be in tomorrow, he will take care of it." A human's assigned lane moving
on their own clock is the normal state, not a risk signal; static tickets are
not stalled work, because people carry state outside tickets. Proposing
pursuit — chasing, nagging, @-mention status demands — misreads the culture
and puts the owner in the position of declining disrespect on a colleague's
behalf. A first-hand status read of a gating item is legitimate; when it
shows a human-held item static, the ask to the owner is a timing question
("do you know their timing?"), never "how shall we mobilise?". Translate
finder and reviewer vocabulary ("chase", "escalate") into this culture before
it reaches any owner-facing surface; blockers are constraints, never personal
assignments.

## A Question About Edits Requests the Assessment, Not the Edits

"What edits do you think should be made?" asks for proposals; it does not
license making them, least of all on a draft the owner is actively editing
(owner, 2026-08-11, on a stocktake draft: "I am still editing, it is still a
draft, and I asked what you thought, I didn't say edit … you did jump the
gun there"). In a numbered owner message each item's mood is parsed
separately: an imperative item (retitle the headings, widen a section) is
applied; an interrogative item is answered with concrete before-and-after
text so acceptance is one word. While the owner is editing a document it is
their surface: never commit it, and after any agent edit to a file they
have open, tell them to reload before continuing, because their editor
buffer overwrites the applied edit on save. The standing instruction from
that thread, "run any edits past me before making them", applies to the
owner's own drafts from that word on; and owner-facing prose documents
carry no artificial hard-wrapped line breaks ("we will let the platforms
handle formatting").

## Stop Words Are Freezes; Cadence Words Change Only by Owner Word

Four owner phrasings bind harder than their length suggests, each learned
by a seat that read it softer:

- **"Cold pause"** (2026-09-13): every owned process stops (each Monitor
  stopped, the heartbeat loop killed), no push, no comms, no question; it
  binds until the owner lifts it, over any peer's word.
- **"Prepare for compaction … then stop all processes"** (2026-09-25 and
  after): a freeze. Stop wakeups and monitors, start nothing until the
  compaction lands, run the wrap programme, write the re-arm recipe in the
  boundary block, and resume only on "carry on". The freeze governs the
  compaction it names and no other.
- **"Acknowledge, record, then stop"** (2026-09-29): no git. The record is
  written and the commit waits for the resume (a seat committed at the
  resume and that was right).
- **A cadence the owner set in words** (45-minute check-ins, a suite
  cadence) changes only by the owner's word: a suite verdict or a plan
  note cannot thin it. A Director thinned one at suite 47 (2026-09-28) and
  withdrew the change to a proposal. Ask, never change.

After a pause lifts, the recorded queue is a hypothesis: read the live
state, send one message to the Director (or, at n=1, re-read the owner's
last word), and wait for the word before acting (owner, 2026-09-14: "get
up to speed, then ask the Director what to do, do not assume").
