# Agent Tooling Frictions Register

Live capture of frictions, gaps, and observed failures in the agent tooling
substrate. Each entry has source citation, observed behaviour, expected
behaviour, candidate cure, target surface, and current status.

**This is a capture surface, not an execution plan.** Items mature into:

1. A line on a `current/` or `future/` plan when they
   fit existing scope, OR
2. A new `current/` or `future/` plan when they
   justify their own work item, OR
3. A direct fix when the cure is small and obvious enough to land in a peer
   plan's commit cycle.

Owner standing direction (Pelagic, event `2dbd74f6` 2026-05-05): _"any
friction with agent tooling should always be noted so the tooling and
documentation can be improved. This is always true, not just for today's
identity-wordlist work. Agents are both users and authors of the tooling, so
agent-observed friction is first-class user feedback."_

## How To Add an Entry

```markdown
### F-NN — Short title

- **Source**: napkin entry / comms event ID / session reference
- **Surface**: which CLI / file / workflow
- **Observed**: what happened
- **Expected**: what should have happened
- **Candidate cure**: smallest concrete change that resolves the friction
- **Target surface**: agent-tools CLI / docs / rule / plan / ADR / PDR
- **Status**: open / partially-addressed / mitigated / addressed-in-plan-X /
  addressed-in-working-tree-YYYY-MM-DD / addressed-in-existing-behaviour /
  superseded
- **Owner direction status**: standing / session-scoped / unsolicited
```

Keep entries terse. Long-form analysis belongs in the napkin or in a
dedicated plan that this entry points to.

## Friction Entries

Status lines are the disposition source of truth. Entries remain in this
section until a consolidation pass moves them; the addressed/mitigated section
below is a cross-reference index, not a second source of truth.
