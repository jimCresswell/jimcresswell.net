## The failure mode

An external process converges through asynchronous rounds on a clock you do
not control. The agent arms monitors or scheduled probes and treats the
armed state as diligence — the probe pattern FEELS disciplined (scheduled,
regular, documented), which is fluency wearing process clothes. But:

- every sleep between probes is a blind window sized exactly for an async
  arrival;
- each "converged now" read is a MOMENT treated as a state — it expires on
  the external clock;
- the cadence rules are satisfied while the convergence obligation silently
  transfers to whoever is actually watching — usually the owner.

The second worked instance proves vigilance and even *reading the lesson*
do not cure it: the structure (a watch that can sleep or exit early) is the
generator, not the attention level.

## The cure

Own the terminal condition, structurally:

- Run a watch whose exit conditions enumerate EVERY terminal state of the
  external loop (merged/closed; new-findings>0; failure), never only the
  happy path, and supervise it — re-arm on every non-terminal exit.
- The only claim you may broadcast is one no later event can un-make (for a
  PR: MERGED). Anything earlier is "ready", never "done".
- On any event, act immediately and fully (full harvest, one bundled
  response), then return to the watch.

The PR-specific canonical shape lives in `pr-lifecycle` Phases 5–6 (the
supervised terminal-condition watch). This pattern is the general form: it
applies to any external convergence loop with async arrivals.

Siblings: `fluency-is-a-failure-vector.md` (the probe cadence arrives as
felt diligence); `substrate-pointer-read-as-current-state.md` (the green
read as a decayed pointer).
