## Principle

A large record — a continuity table's cell, a thread-record identity row, a
multi-clause status paragraph — reads to a human as one fact, but is often
authored as several independent sentences accreted over time. When a fact
inside it changes, editing only the sentence a review finding quoted leaves
every *other* sentence in the same cell or row that also asserted the old
state untouched. A cell or row is one record, not a bag of independently
truable sentences.

## Worked Instance (2026-07-08, two rounds)

Truing a stale state inside a large table cell, editing only the sentence a
review finding had quoted, left stale in **round 1** an earlier clause in the
same cell, and in **round 2** the trailing identity column still asserting
the old state. The fact was only fully corrected on the third pass, after
grepping the whole artefact for every assertion of the old state (`is OPEN`,
`still to reply/resolve`).

## Countermeasure

When a fact changes inside a large record, **grep the WHOLE artefact for
every assertion of the old state** before declaring the truing done — every
string the old state could plausibly have been rendered as (a status word, a
SHA, an "OPEN"/"unresolved" phrase) — not just the one sentence a finding
pointed at. Treat the record as one unit that must agree with itself
end-to-end, never as independent sentences to patch one at a time.
