## Failure shape

A verdict a seat waits on (merged / settled / ratified / deployed) is
carried by exactly ONE push signal with no pull reconciliation. When
that signal drops — a missed broadcast, a dropped webhook, a dead
watcher window — the wait stalls silently: from inside, "still
pending" and "signal lost" look identical.

- A settle watch that covered the CHECKS leg only sat blocked 13.5
  minutes on a PR that had already merged — the merge broadcast was
  the sole push signal and it was missed once.
- A settle watch with no Sonar-reported leg waited on a webhook the
  vendor had dropped; the cure was a pull-shaped re-fire
  (empty-commit push).

## Cures

- **Two independent signals per awaited verdict** — e.g. the event
  broadcast AND the state read (PR merge state alongside check state),
  or the webhook AND a vendor-API poll.
- **Or one signal plus a pull backstop**: a bounded re-poll of the
  authoritative state at a cadence matched to the verdict's expected
  latency. The backstop converts "signal lost" from a silent stall
  into a bounded delay.
- **A stored/frozen claim is never the second signal** — an armed
  intent's stale body, a cached status line, or a remembered state
  restates the first signal's past, it does not independently observe
  the present.

The arming-time question: *if the one signal I am waiting on drops,
what tells me?*
