# A Server Component Reads Its Data Layer Directly

> **POLARITY: PATTERN.** The typed direct call is *inside* the trust
> boundary — the runtime guard the self-fetch needed deletes too.

## The shape

1. The server component imports and calls the data-layer function
   directly (the same function the Route Handler would call). Route
   Handlers exist for *external* consumers, not for the app's own
   server-rendered pages.
2. The direct call is typed end-to-end, so the `unknown`-narrowing
   apparatus a fetch boundary requires (guard + validator) is deleted,
   not relocated — `strict-validation-at-boundary` targets untrusted
   input, and an in-process typed call is not one.
3. Verify framework best practice against the LIVE official docs (the
   installed package's bundled docs are version-accurate), never from
   memory — the self-fetch shape reads plausibly and used to be common.

## The sibling module-boundary rule

Client-boundary guards and view-models must NOT live in a `server-only`
module: a client component importing the runtime value pulls
`server-only` into the client bundle and `next build` fails. Shared
view-models + runtime guards go in a client-safe `*-types.ts`;
SDK/secret wiring stays server-only (worked instance 2026-06-30:
`isSearchResults` moved from the server-only search client to a
client-safe types module).
