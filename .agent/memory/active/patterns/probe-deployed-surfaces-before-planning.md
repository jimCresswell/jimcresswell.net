## Failure shape

A plan, card set, or adjudication about a deployed surface is grounded
in documents, ADRs, and code — never the running system. The plan then
asks the owner questions the deployment answers ("what domain? what
realm?"), frames work as greenfield that is actually a config change on
a live, verified service, and every reviewer in the chain shares the
blind spot because reviewers verify artefacts by default. The owner's
diagnostic question: *"did you explore the code before you asked the
questions?"* — and the deployment is part of the code.

## Cures

- **Probe first, then plan**: before authoring anything about a
  deployed surface, probe it first-hand — metadata endpoints, challenge
  shapes, env/realm reality, response headers. Minutes of curl reframe
  hours of planning.
- **The probe joins the evidence base**: deployed-surface plans AND
  their review/adjudication verdicts require a first-hand deployment
  probe in the cited evidence. Artefact-only grounding plus
  artefact-only review is a collective blind spot, not redundancy.
- **Ground in the organisation's existing practice**: for vendor
  integrations, the grounding set includes where the org already runs
  that vendor (grep the sibling estates), not just the vendor's docs
  and the local repo.
- **Diagnosis-time face — instrument the boundary before theorising
  about it** (owner-named disproportion, 2026-07-25 Copilot hook arc):
  when a boundary fails opaquely (an exit code and nothing else), one
  payload-shape + per-layer-exit trace line AT the boundary
  discriminates the failing layer immediately, where hypothesis-testing
  against SYNTHETIC envelopes burned hours across three stacked
  indirections. Record input shape, layer identity, and verdict first;
  expand to general diagnostics only if that evidence cannot
  discriminate. Twin discipline: absence of an instrument's rows is
  evidence about the INSTRUMENT'S coverage first, never about the
  boundary's behaviour (a retracted verdict came from reading absent
  capture rows as exit-0); and a session can hold STALE loaded hook
  state through /restart — prove which config the live process actually
  loaded before testing hypotheses against the one on disk.
