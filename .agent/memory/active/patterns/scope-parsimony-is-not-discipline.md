# Scope Parsimony Is Not Discipline

## The anti-pattern

Under review pressure, an agent optimises for the **smallest defensible diff**: the
narrowest change is the easiest to justify and the fastest to land, so scoping rules
(YAGNI, `consolidate-at-second-consumer`, don't-extract-single-consumer-abstractions,
plan-scope hygiene, "that's an external constraint") get reached for as *cost-avoidance
heuristics* rather than by their actual warrants. The result reads as discipline —
every deferral cites a rule — while the system freezes around whatever already exists.

This is the quiet cousin of the rush impulse that `principles.md`
§Architectural-Excellence-Over-Expediency names: not *"cheap because fast"* but
**"narrow because defensible."** The feedback is asymmetric — overreach gets challenged
in review immediately; timidity is only visible as a pattern, usually to the owner,
after several instances.

## The tell

- A real rule cited with the wrong warrant: the rule's precondition (speculation, an
  imagined future consumer, a genuinely external system) does not hold, but the rule's
  *name* is doing the justificatory work.
- "We can't change X" where X is inside the estate (a workspace, a boundary config, our
  own app's auth surface). Nothing in the estate is frozen; boundaries are configured,
  never obeyed blindly.
- Deferral language accumulating in one artefact: "at a second consumer", "when Y
  exists", "premature", "out of scope for this plan" — each individually defensible.

## The cure

At every decomposition or deferral point ask the corrective question:

> **Does this thing have an independent identity worth defining, describing, and
> testing in isolation?** — never *"can we defer it?"*

If yes, articulating it (its own workspace, its own contract, its own tests) is not
speculation — it is articulation of something already real. The anti-speculation rules
exist to prevent *invented* abstractions; they do not forbid giving present, real
functionality its own describable identity. And when a constraint blocks a legitimate
need, first-principles-check the constraint itself (decision lens 4: would it be
simpler if the system changed?) before fitting the work to it.

## Relationship to neighbouring patterns

- [`precedent-compounding-is-the-mechanism-of-entropy`](precedent-compounding-is-the-mechanism-of-entropy.md)
  — the same failure family from the opposite side: precedent-compounding reuses a
  landed shape *because it landed*; scope-parsimony refuses a right shape *because the
  narrower one is defensible*. Both substitute procedural legitimacy for
  principle-compliance.
- [`never-disable-checks`](../../../rules/never-disable-checks.md) §Configuring a check
  to express the architecture is not disabling it — the boundary-config instance of the
  same regime at lint altitude (2026-07-08); this pattern generalises it to plans,
  workspaces, and auth surfaces.
