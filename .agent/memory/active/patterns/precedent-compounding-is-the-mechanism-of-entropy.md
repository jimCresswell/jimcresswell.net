## The failure mode

In a large estate every landed artefact becomes a licence-shaped precedent.
The compounding loop: an exception lands with paperwork (a recorded reason, a
review approval, an allowlist entry) → the paperwork manufactures
process-legitimacy → the next agent (or reviewer, or bot) cites the landed
shape as the idiom → gateways rate the *procedure* compliant → the exception
class grows. **Process-compliance is not principle-compliance** — every step
can be procedurally correct and every step entropy. A violation-allowlist is
the crystallised form: an escape hatch with paperwork, institutionalising
exceptions to a rule whose whole point is exceptionlessness.

The reviewer face makes it worse: reviewers recommend precedent-matching
shapes ("mirror the landed NET_C test"), so the compounding survives review —
the same audit-shaped test was wrong twice, recommended once.

## The cure

- **Precedent triggers the principle check, never waives it.** When the
  justification for a shape is "a landed artefact already does this", that is
  the tripwire to run the governing principle (`principles.md` §Strict and
  Complete, the Decision Lenses) over THIS site — first-principles review
  beat precedent twice in one arc.
- **Check the precedent's recorded rationale before reuse.** A precedent with
  no recorded rationale, or a rationale grounded in a different site shape,
  transfers nothing.
- **Category-relocation over exemption, and gates land strict in one
  landing** — the structural forms are PDR-126's Decision; this pattern is
  the failure mechanism that PDR forecloses.

Siblings: `fluency-is-a-failure-vector.md` (the precedent arrives fluently —
"the estate already does this" is a fluent frame);
`legitimate-principle-as-avoidance-cover.md` (paperwork as legitimacy).
