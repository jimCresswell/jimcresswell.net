A shared substrate — a comms directory, a claims registry, a workspace a
built CLI resolves — has live readers the moment it exists. Relocating it
is not one edit but three coupled ones:

1. **Move** the files (`git mv` or equivalent).
2. **Repoint every reader** — path constants, configs, hooks, docs,
   watcher invocations — found by searching for the old path, not from
   memory.
3. **Rebuild** any dist/compiled artefact that embeds the old path.

All three must land within one window (one commit, or one tightly
sequenced set with peers paused). A relocation that stops after step 1
breaks canonical comms and tooling **team-wide** until the trailing steps
complete: peers' watchers watch a dead directory, CLIs write to a decoy,
and the failure is silent (see the comms decoy-directory class in
[`comms-all-channels-watcher`](../../../rules/comms-all-channels-watcher.md)
§Known Silent-Failure Class).

Before the move, enumerate readers with a literal-path sweep; after it,
prove one end-to-end read/write through the new location before declaring
the relocation done.
