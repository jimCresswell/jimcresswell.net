## Principle

When two documents appear to conflict, run a clause-by-clause **crosswalk before
rewriting**, separating three cases per clause:

- **(a) Shared intent** — the same intent expressed in different vocabulary. Adopt;
  do not rewrite for vocabulary's sake.
- **(b) Genuine divergence** — a real contradiction requiring supersession. Mark the
  specific clause superseded, citing what supersedes it.
- **(c) Orthogonal** — concerns that only look like conflict because they share
  vocabulary or surface. Leave untouched.

The default hypothesis to test — not to assume away — is that the tension is
**semantics rather than intent** (owner instinct, 2026-06-05). A blunt "rewrite to
match the new model" destroys still-valid content in case (a) and deletes real work
in case (c).

## The Reconciliation Shape

Reconcile **surgically**: a top banner stating the crosswalk verdict, plus targeted
supersession notes only on the genuinely-divergent clauses; preserve the rest; name
which case each part is. The reader of the reconciled document sees exactly what
was superseded, by what, and why the remainder stands.

## Worked Instance

2026-06-05, the EEF strategy brief vs the ratified plan: clauses R1/R4/R5/R7/R8
were *shared intent* (adopted as-is); only R2/R3's server-side scoring was *genuine*
supersession (by Decision 10); and §5's future ontology crosswalk was *orthogonal*
(a data artefact, not the forbidden situation→strand server mapping). A bulk
rewrite would have wrongly deleted §5.

## Boundary

This pattern governs reconciling two documents' *content*. It is distinct from
`derive-controlled-surface-from-authoritative-data.md`: a *crosswalk artefact* (a
persistent mapping layer) is only legitimate between two surfaces you do not
control — that boundary lives in the sibling pattern. Here "crosswalk" is the
*analysis move* (clause-by-clause comparison), not a built artefact.

  — the sibling that bounds when a built crosswalk is ever legitimate.

  — governs the prose left behind by the supersession notes: state the surviving
  design positively.
