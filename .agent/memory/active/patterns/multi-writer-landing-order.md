# Multi-Writer Landing Order: Deletion-Bearing Bundles Commit First

> **POLARITY: PATTERN.** This is a shape to repeat: the cure is landing
> ORDER, never file resurrection.

## The mechanism

Whole-tree validators that fail loud on tracked-but-missing files (the
machine-local-paths class) read the WORKTREE, not the staged set. So
one lane's pending tracked-file deletion blocks **all** lanes' commits
— including unrelated pathspec commits, because a pathspec commit
builds its temporary index from HEAD + pathspec while the deletion
still sits in the tree.

## The shape

1. **The deleting lane's cycle commits FIRST** — deletion-bearing
   bundles take priority within any commit train.
2. **Never resurrect a final-intent deletion** to unblock a commit —
   the deletion is forward motion; restoring it to green a gate
   reverses decided work (and restore-shaped commands are themselves
   hook-blocked in comms for this reason).
3. **Compose with the one-index multi-cycle commit train** when several
   lanes' work must land from one mixed tree: pathspec-commit (cycle A,
   worktree state) → plain commit (cycle B's pre-staged index snapshot
   survives untouched) → add+commit (cycle C delta).
4. When a mid-cycle lane blocks the tree entirely, ask that lane for a
   **compile/lint-green checkpoint** (their green unstaged WIP rides in
   the tree while the train runs; their commit lands later) — don't
   wait for slice completion.
