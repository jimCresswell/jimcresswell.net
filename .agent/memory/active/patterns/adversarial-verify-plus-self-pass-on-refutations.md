## Principle

"Critically assess all subagent output" is usually read as "check that the
confirmed findings are real." That is only half the assessment. A
triage/verification agent also **downgrades, refutes, or marks items
already-decided** — and those downgrades are themselves claims that can be
wrong, made by an agent with no more authority than the one that produced
the original finding. Assessing only the confirmed half and trusting the
rejected half by default inverts the verification discipline exactly where
it matters least visibly: a wrongly-dropped finding never resurfaces for a
second look, while a wrongly-confirmed one usually gets caught downstream.

## Worked Instance (2026-07-08, PR #328 deep review)

In an open-question triage round, two review lenses marked a ZDR-contract
question "ALREADY-DECIDED" by citing the estate's own "confirm this" note —
but a note stating something *needs* confirming is not itself a decision.
The miscategorisation was caught only because the review explicitly went
back and re-read the DROPPED (already-decided / refuted) set, not just the
surviving confirmed set. The owner made the discipline explicit: *"critically
assessing all does not mean assessing half."*

## Countermeasure

Run two passes, not one, whenever a verification/triage agent produces both
a confirmed set and a rejected/downgraded set:

1. **Adversarial-verify the confirmed set** — the ordinary discipline: check
   each surviving claim against its cited evidence.
2. **Self-pass the rejected set** — re-read every item the verifier marked
   refuted, already-decided, duplicate, or out-of-scope, and check the
   *verifier's* reasoning for that downgrade against the actual source,
   exactly as skeptically as the confirmed set was checked.

Both passes are required before treating a triage round as complete; passing
only the first is the failure mode this pattern names.
