# Enforce via Schema, Don't Enumerate in Prose, for Vendor Surfaces

## Pattern

When prose re-lists the fields/enums/values of a moving external specification
so agents can author against it, that enumeration is the drift surface. Replace
it: make an **enforced, localised schema the single source of truth**, and have
the prose **point at the schema** instead of re-listing values that go stale.

A worked instance: the `subagent-architect` prose enumerated each platform's
wrapper frontmatter and had drifted hard — the official Claude sub-agent spec had
gained nine fields, its colour list named invalid values that were live in
wrappers, and Cursor had no `tools` field at all. The cure was a per-platform Zod
frontmatter schema as the SSOT, wired into `validate-subagents`; the prose now
references it. Currency moves from drift-prone prose into one enforced, localised,
auditable file.

## Why this works

- **The enforced gate beats review by a class, not a margin.** On the same
  surface, the schema validator caught three invalid colours and twenty-two
  non-conformant fields; a careful first-hand currency review of the prose had
  caught one. Build the gate; the gate finds the violations
  (sibling: [`governance-claim-needs-a-scanner.md`](governance-claim-needs-a-scanner.md)).
- **It relocates currency work, it does not remove it.** A local schema that
  mirrors a moving spec needs a reconcile anchor: carry the official-doc URL and
  a `lastVerified` date per source, guarded by a unit test, and re-run the
  currency check on a platform-release signal. Do not fetch-in-CI (brittle); make
  the re-check an explicit, auditable, re-runnable workflow.

## The reflexive case

This is documentation-is-infrastructure (ADR-127 §5) applied to agent
definitions: the same SSOT/DRY discipline that governs code content governs the
prose that describes a controlled surface. It is the constructive twin of
[`fidelity-audit-is-not-currency-audit.md`](fidelity-audit-is-not-currency-audit.md)
— don't audit drift out of prose by hand, design the prose so it cannot drift.

  same coin.
