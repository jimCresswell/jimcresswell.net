## The failure mode

A filter, glob, or path scope silently selects nothing (or something other
than what you named), and the tool legitimately exits 0. The exit code is
honest — the operation was vacuous. Worked variants, each observed live:

- A targeted vitest path/name filter that matches no file either runs zero
  tests and reports green, or silently expands to the full workspace run —
  either way the "targeted" verdict was never produced.
- `markdownlint-cli` without `--dot` matches zero files under any
  dot-directory path (e.g. `.agent/**`), prints usage, and exits 0 — a
  structural false-green that voided every prior targeted pass over that
  tree. (Separately, its globs do not respect `.gitignore`, so the
  opposite error — linting files you meant to exclude — also occurs.)

Siblings in the same false-green family:
[`wrapped-exit-codes-false-green.md`](wrapped-exit-codes-false-green.md)
(the verdict belongs to a wrapper, not the operation) and
[`turbo-cache-false-green.md`](turbo-cache-false-green.md) (the verdict is
a replay of a past run). Here the verdict belongs to the right operation
and the right run — but the operation was empty.

## The cure

When a filtered run is load-bearing, verify the match count, never just
the exit code: read the runner's reported file/test count, require it to
be non-zero (and plausibly sized), and prefer configurations that fail on
empty selection (e.g. vitest without `passWithNoTests`). For sweep tools,
prove the filter on one known-matching file before trusting a green sweep.

Recurrence variant (2026-07-08, despite this home): two comms gap sweeps
globbed `*.json` from the wrong cwd and reported "clean" on zero files —
shell cwd is context-dependent (reset between calls in some harness
contexts, drift-prone after `cd` in others; the F-125 family), so either
way it cannot be assumed. Cures: absolute paths in sweep commands, and
treat empty output over a directory that SHOULD have content as a refusal,
never a pass — a gate over nothing never passes.

Further instances, 2026-09-10 to 2026-09-16, the same generator in other
instruments: `prettier --check` over an ignored path printed "All matched files
use Prettier code style!" while matching zero files (`--file-info` returns
`ignored: true` and discriminates); BSD `xargs` has no `-a` and refuses it on
stderr with exit 1, but the sweep composed around it read neither, so a sweep
over nothing read clean; a shell ate four code spans from a comms body and the
send reported success. The verdict-channel form is the same generator one level
up: an instrument that watches only the channels failures arrive on reads a
positive result as silence. The merge door read review objects only, so a
vendor's explicit zero-findings completion comment read as "no review", and a
watcher with no positive liveness line was read as "still waiting" for ten
minutes while the checks moved from none to nineteen passing (frictions F-164). The cure there is a positive-evidence channel
for every leg, and a verdict that names whether it concluded from PRESENCE or
from ABSENCE (the `landing-instruments-read-the-evidence` node carries the
door's form).

The authored form (2026-09-17, two instances in one fold's pre-publication
pass): a seat's own absence claim in a record is a zero-match reading too. A
friction entry said no instrument reads a session's context usage, and
`agent-tools session-metadata` does; a disposition policy said no path
exclusion exists, and one did. In both the seat had searched one tool or one
file, not the surface the claim covered (the CLI's command list, the whole
configuration). Cure: an absence claim carries its search beside it, the
command and its scope, so a reader can see what "none" was measured over.
