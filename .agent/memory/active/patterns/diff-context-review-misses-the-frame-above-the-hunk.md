A harness whole-file view, not any diff, exposed the first."

## The failure shape

A long-lived entry (a plan status line, a continuity entry, a batch
record) is updated repeatedly by appending or editing its tail. Each
edit's diff context covers a few lines around the change. The entry's
FRAME — the opening sentence that states its scope, count, range, or
verdict — was written when the entry was young and is invalidated by
the accumulating tail, but it appears in no diff, so:

- the author's self-review never re-reads it (they review the diff);
- reviewers anchored to `file:line` findings never reach it;
- the fitness/lint gates see well-formed prose either way.

The result is an entry whose header contradicts its own body, surviving
multiple review rounds, misdirecting the next reader who (correctly)
trusts the frame as the summary of what follows.

## The cure

Before committing the Nth edit to the same entry, **re-read the entry
from its first line**, not from the edit site. Concretely:

- Treat the semantic unit (the entry, the section, the record row) as
  the review scope, never the hunk.
- When updating a tail repeatedly, grep the entry's frame for the
  now-stale tokens the update obsoletes (the old range, the old count,
  the old batch name) — the stale token is usually literal.
- Reviewer briefs for repeated-edit files should say "read the whole
  entry the diff touches", not just "review the diff".

  the whole bundle, not the remembered edits).
- `.agent/rules/no-moving-targets-in-permanent-docs.md` — frames that
  state volatile facts are moving targets by construction; where the
  frame can be made derivation-anchored instead, do that.
