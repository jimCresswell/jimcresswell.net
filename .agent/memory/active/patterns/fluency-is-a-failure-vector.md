> **POLARITY: ANTI-PATTERN.** A failure mode to avoid. The name is the diagnostic: when the move arrives smoothly, recognising the shape is the first step in not repeating it. See [`README.md` § Polarity](README.md#polarity-required-every-pattern).

# Fluency Is a Failure Vector

Imported from the lineage at pin `e477e62f7` on 2026-09-14 (practice-completion closure item 4, row 6, under todo 1's one-link precedent). The worked instances and measurements are the lineage's; local divergence is recorded where it exists.

The dual of friction. Friction is information you are tempted to *under*-read; fluency
— a move or justification that arrives *smoothly* — is information you are tempted to
*over*-trust. The easier a justification arrives, the less it was actually grounded:
smoothness is exactly what bypasses the situational check. So a fluent move is the
**trigger to ground the situational fact first**, not confirmation to proceed.

## Anti-pattern

Fluency wears ordinary clothes: a local convention obvious to match ("match the
surrounding code"); an owner statement that seems to license a shortcut ("they said
*only agent* → stand down the watcher"); a claim that feels true ("commits pushed" —
said before the push); an "of course X" framing. None of these is ignorance — a smooth
frame arrived and was acted on before the situation it presupposes was checked. The
2026-06-18 consolidation produced four in one session (chasing a critical fitness
number; about to silently delete recurring duplicates; inventing three deferral gates
one turn after authoring the no-gates PDR).

## The cure

The fluent arrival is **itself** the tripwire to re-ground, and the smoother the move,
the harder the check must be. Ground the situation before acting: *was the convention
ever ratified? is the precondition constitutive regardless of the stated situation? is
the claim true right now?* Naming this does **not** inoculate against it — a fluent move
under context pressure overrides a passively-held lesson (the conservation reflex recurs
even while you document it). So the cure is structural — an external check or a firing
gate — not self-vigilance.

## The escape-hatch generative screen (general form)

The escape-hatch reflex re-skins per situation but is always one move — make
the friction vanish without doing the complete correct thing. Four observed
faces: **deferral** ("a later gate"), **menu** (a forced conclusion offered as
an A/B choice), **list-op** (rank-and-cut where a complete result is
required), **suppress-the-signal** (exclude a path from a check, raise a
threshold, mark a hotspot safe without review). Cataloguing costumes does not
immunise — the reflex finds new ones faster than they can be listed — so the
cure is the generative question, run before surfacing ANY disposition,
options list, or "we could also…": *does this make a valid signal or
requirement go away without the complete correct fix?* If yes, strike it and
state the single valid cure as a verdict; padding a forced answer with a
cheap co-equal is itself the failure (owner-caught four times in one
2026-05-28 session, including immediately after the lesson was written down).

## Instance: gate-evasion (the escape-hatch screen)

A sharp, recurring instance lives at a quality gate. When a fix that clears a gate
(SonarCloud duplication density, a lint rule, a failing assertion) arrives *smoothly*,
that smoothness is the tripwire to run the **escape-hatch screen** before accepting it:
*does this make the gate's valid signal vanish without delivering the complete fix it
names?* The failure shape is **gate-evasion** — and its most insidious form is
**camouflaged duplication**: restructuring a duplicated shape just enough that the
copy-paste detector stops token-matching it, so the green check returns while the
coupling it flagged stays (often *worse*, now disguised as two unrelated sites). A green
checkmark over a worse codebase is not the impact; curing the defect the gate names is.
Worked instance (2026-06-29, #282): a first fix reshaped a duplicated arg-parser to dodge
the CPD detector; the cure was the real one the gate pointed at — **extract the shared
owner** (`core/cli-arg-parser`) and migrate both consumers (consolidate at the second
consumer). The escape-hatch screen is the specific firing-gate for this instance of the
general anti-pattern.
