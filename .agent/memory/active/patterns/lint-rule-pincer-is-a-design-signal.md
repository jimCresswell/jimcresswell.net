# A Lint-Rule Pincer Is a Design Signal

> **POLARITY: PATTERN.** When every local shape is banned, the design
> wants a structural move, not a cleverer local shape.

## The shape

1. Enumerate the shapes the rules jointly ban — if every *in-place*
   variant trips one rule or the other, stop iterating locally.
2. Ask what structural move dissolves the pincer: move state out of the
   component (external store), split the file's responsibilities,
   extract the seam. The joint constraint usually names the move.
3. The result is architecture the rules were designed to produce —
   `tool-error-as-question` applied to a rule *pair*.

Composes with `principled-eslint-zoning` (the legitimate scoped-zone
case is build tooling / generated artefacts — app logic never zones its
way out of a pincer) and `never-disable-checks`.
