# The Practice inventory, 2026-10-02

One row per artefact of the Practice present in either estate's default tip, generated from the two trees' blob ids (`practice_inventory.py`, in the session state directory of the second two-estate consolidation): kind by directory; scope class under PDR-143 §1 by directory default, with hand overrides by name where §2's membership test says an artefact names one host (its people, its product, its platform set); sameness by blob id. Heads: JC.net main SHA:f4a1c7496, OCE engraph SHA:38342e038. Rows: 3555. This report is the input the extraction plan takes (practice-work-finish, end state 3); the exchange register closes against it.

Reading the sameness column: a platform adapter is rendered from the canonical content with the host's prefix, so adapters differ or stand one-sided by design and say nothing about the canonical; a skill's evals and fixtures are counted as their own kind because one estate holds the eval runner and the other does not; tooling differs by topic, and a topic one estate alone holds is either a capability to carry (Language-wide) or product tooling (Repo-local, host). The hand overrides by name are the regular expression in the generator; a row whose scope reads with a §2 note was placed by that override, every other row by its directory.
