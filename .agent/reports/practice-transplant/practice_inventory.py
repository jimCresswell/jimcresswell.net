"""The Practice inventory (practice-work-finish, end state 3): one row per artefact of the Practice
in either estate's default tip, with its kind, its PDR-143 scope class by directory default (hand
overrides by name where §2's membership test says otherwise), and whether the two estates' copies
are the same bytes. Generated from the two trees' blob ids; no file content is read.
