  Produce and read rendered proof (screenshots, focus-state renders,
  DOM-fact echoes) for any verdict on visual work — layout, rendering,
  theming, or interaction behaviour. Use before claiming a visual
  surface renders correctly, before and after curing a visual defect,
  after placement or order changes, and before telling the owner a
  visual deliverable is done. Runs the design-showcase visual probe.

# Visual Verification

Rendered proof for design verdicts: how to produce, read, and pair the
artefacts that PDR-138 and the `visual-verdicts-require-rendered-proof`
rule demand. The design register's decision is DDR-011.

## When this skill fires

- You are about to claim anything about a visual surface: layout,
  rendering, theming, focus/interaction behaviour, "no regression".
- You are curing a visual defect (red proof first, green proof after).
- You changed anything that owns placement or order (grid areas, region
  markers, order-affecting CSS) — full-page render afterwards.
- You are about to tell the owner a visual deliverable is done.

## The instrument

This repository's instrument is the site's visual-regression harness
(`jcdotnet/visual-regression-harness/`, run from the root):

```bash
pnpm visual-regression:harness
```

It builds and serves the base and target snapshots on two ports, renders
the configured routes at the configured viewports, and prints the output
directory holding the renders and diffs. Options (`--repo-root`,
`--output-dir`, `--base-port`, `--target-port`) are listed in
`jcdotnet/visual-regression-harness/cli.ts`; the routes and viewports
come from the harness configuration, never from ad-hoc flags.

The lineage's per-route probe (an `--origin`/`--route`/`--tabs`
instrument that captures a focus-state render and echoes
`document.activeElement` in-band) is not ported here. When a proof needs
a focus-state or single-route render the harness does not produce, the
rendered proof comes from a Playwright run against the production build
(`pnpm test:e2e`), and porting the probe is a capability decision, not a
default.

## Reading the proof

1. **Read the image first-hand** (the Read tool renders PNGs). A green
   suite tick is an invariant check, not a read; the verdict needs your
   eyes on the pixels.
2. **Interaction claims need the state visible on the pixels** — a focus
   ring, a revealed skip link, an opened control — AND the DOM-fact echo
   agreeing. Pixels without the fact, or the fact without pixels, is
   half a proof.
3. **Cure pairs**: capture red BEFORE touching the code (a Playwright
   failure screenshot from a red cell also serves), green after, same
   route and viewport, so the pair differs only in the claim.
4. **Proof is regenerated, never archived** (PDR-138): artefacts stay in
   scratch space. What persists is the instrument, the record, and any
   suite cell that now guards the invariant.

## Worked instance

The F01/F02 keyboard blackout (PR #846, 2026-08-13). Every code gate was
green; the first rendered artefact showed a beautiful page where 30 Tab
presses focused nothing. Red: the trail-of-`outside` failure screenshot.
Green: `--tabs 1` rendering the focus ring on `#picker-identity-select`,
echo `select#picker-identity-select`. Layout confirmation: `--full-page`
after the `data-region` row pin. The cure's cells now guard the class in
CI; the probe proved the specific claim at the moment of the verdict.
