# The Practice Skills Corpus

`.agent/skills/` is the Practice skills corpus (owner ruling,
2026-08-02): skills about creating this repository, its contents and
mechanisms, and enabling future mechanisms — not about the host's
product content (in OCE, pedagogy and curriculum content). The name
lands here in doctrine; the path stays `.agent/skills`.

Each skill's canonical form is its `SKILL-CANONICAL.md`; the platform
adapters under `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` are generated
by the `agent-tools` skills-adapter generator — edit canonicals,
never adapters. Vendored external skills, where the host has any, live
only in the adapter tier, pinned by its `skills-lock.json`.

The canonical definitions here group by concern (a family directory per
concern — cognition, change-custody, knowledge, orientation, planning,
specification, lever-authoring, reviewer-companions, domain-craft, and so on);
the generated platform adapters stay flat. That is an owner decision
(2026-08-07, verbatim: "I want skills grouped by concern, at least in the
core skills definitions, the vendor specific projections can remain flat.
That is a user decision and I have made it, no debate required"): flat
listings optimise the adapter and runtime layer, and concern-grouping is
the discovery structure for the humans and agents navigating the corpus.

Where a new capability lands — in this corpus, another audience set,
or another lever entirely — is decided by
[the capability landing decision procedure](../rules/capability-landing-decision-procedure.md).

## Audience-set registry

One row per audience set. A capability that fits no existing set
does not stretch one: a new set lands deliberately, through the
landing procedure, as a new row here.

| Audience set | Audience | Home | Delivery mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Practice skills corpus | agents and humans building this repository and its mechanisms | `.agent/skills/` | generated platform adapters (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`) |
| Product skills (OCE: curriculum and teacher skills) | the host's users (OCE: teachers and other users of its curriculum content) | the host's plugin manifest (OCE: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) | Claude plugin marketplace |

Three corpora share the word "skills" and nothing else (owner, 2026-08-17:
"the current skills lane is ONLY about the Practice skills, it is not about
the user facing skills"): the Practice skills here in `.agent/skills`; the
user-facing product skills, where the host has them (OCE's Claude plugin under
`claude/plugins/` — for any Claude host, never "the Claude Code plugin",
owner, 2026-09-17 — and its ChatGPT and Codex package under
`chatgpt/plugins/`), with their own lane and owners; and third-party
vendor-managed skills installed by the host's vendored-skills installer (OCE's
`skills` script) into `.agents/skills` (the
`third-party-skills-require-security-review` rule governs them). Every lane
quantifier — "finish the skill work", "all Practice skills have evals" —
ranges over `.agent/skills` only; conflating any two mis-scopes sweeps,
evals, reviews and lane quantifiers, so when a path, a command or a PR says
"skills", resolve WHICH corpus before acting.
