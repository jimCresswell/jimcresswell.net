  Create and verify a lane worktree: the branch cut explicitly from origin/<base>,
  the inherited bot identity verified with no worktree-scoped override, deps
  installed, .env.local carried, a draft PR at first push; in a detected ChatGPT
  Work cloud host, static branch/base checks only with execution routed to
  draft-PR CI. Use for a new lane or a misbehaving worktree (commits attributed
  to nobody, missing env, hook failures). Not for switching branches in place,
  changing session residency alone, or disposing of a worktree. Wrong looks
  like: EnterWorktree fresh mode basing the branch on the principal's
  coordination HEAD so the lane PR ships foreign commits; the bot commit email
  carrying the app id instead of the bot user id, which resolves to no GitHub
  user.

# Set Up a Worktree Lane

**Governance**: the procedure that composes three rules at the one moment they all
apply — [`worktree-residency`](../../rules/worktree-residency.md) (where you work and
how residency is established), [`worktree-hygiene`](../../rules/worktree-hygiene.md)
(lane lifecycle, the first-push draft PR, dispositions), and
[`bot-identity-on-third-party-systems`](../../rules/bot-identity-on-third-party-systems.md)
(who commits, and under whose authority). Those rules own the doctrine and the
reasoning; this skill owns the ordered steps and the verification, because every
defect below was found in a worktree that satisfied each rule read separately.

## Use When

- Taking up a lane that needs its own checkout (the normal case — new branch work
  never starts on the principal).
- A worktree is behaving oddly: commits attributed to no GitHub user, a gate failing
  for reasons unrelated to the change, a build that cannot find its environment.
- Auditing an inherited worktree before trusting it.

Not for: switching branches in place; the session-level residency switch on its own
(`EnterWorktree` — step 4 here); disposing of a finished worktree (that is
`worktree-hygiene` §6).

## The procedure

### 0. Classify the host before setup

Use the tri-state classification in
[`cloud-environment-routing.md`](../../directives/cloud-environment-routing.md).
If it selects ChatGPT Work, keep that profile for the whole session. It replaces
the identity and buildability work in steps 2 and 3: read the transport
credential (`gh auth status`; the credential helper or SSH key for `git push`)
so the name a remote write will display is known — not `git config user.email`,
which names only the author — but do not mint or rewrite bot credentials; do not install or run pnpm, Corepack, builds, tests or local
gates. Use the configured default credential and the
`HUSKY=0`/draft-PR/CI route in step 6. Detector error is a stop; a genuine
not-Work result does not by itself identify Claude cloud.

### 1. Cut the branch with an explicit start point

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add <path> -b <branch> origin/<base>
```

`<base>` is the repository's default branch (refreshed with `git remote set-head origin --auto`, then
read with `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` and the `origin/` prefix
stripped, or `gh repo view <owner>/<name> --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name`
with the repository named — derived at the moment of use, never a literal;
[`downstream-checkout-never-writes-upstream-surfaces`](../../rules/downstream-checkout-never-writes-upstream-surfaces.md)
verifies both reads), because the default branch is identity held below the tree.
For a build-ahead lane it is the parent branch the worktree is cut from
([`worktree-hygiene`](../../rules/worktree-hygiene.md) §1), so the worktree carries the
parent's changes; its draft PR opens against the default branch at first push, the diff
carrying the parent's commits until the parent lands, and is never based on the parent;
once the parent has landed, bring the child onto the default branch before any check against
it — by a merge when the parent landed by merge commit, by a re-cut with the child's own
commits cherry-picked across when it landed by squash (its commits are not ancestors then).
The explicit `origin/<base>` is load-bearing. `EnterWorktree`'s fresh mode documents
branching from the remote's default branch but, with `worktree.baseRef` set to `"head"`
in any settings layer, bases the branch on the **principal's checked-out HEAD** — a
coordination-branch tip on this estate — so the lane PR ships coordination commits
riding under the story. That cost a close-and-recreate cycle once already
(PR #673 → #674).

### 2. Verify the commit identity — inherited, never re-set here

This step applies to standard and separately provisioned profiles only. In a
detected ChatGPT Work cloud session, step 0 replaces it completely.

The identity lives once in the clone's shared local config and every worktree
inherits it (owner ruling 2026-08-04; doctrine in
[`bot-identity-on-third-party-systems`](../../rules/bot-identity-on-third-party-systems.md)).
A new worktree therefore needs no identity step at all — only a check that what it
inherited is right:

```bash
git -C <path> config user.email
# expect: 307435217+jimbot-oakington-iii[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
```

If that is wrong or absent, fix the SHARED config once. Never patch this worktree: a
`--worktree` override is a second copy that outlives the next correction and
reintroduces the exact drift this step exists to catch.

```bash
# The merge-bot config is per-checkout and never tracked, so it lives only at
# the clone's primary checkout; a linked worktree holds no copy of it. Every
# derivation is checked before the shared identity is written: an empty slug
# or id would otherwise land as "[bot]" while the block exits clean.
PRIMARY="$(git worktree list --porcelain | head -1 | sed 's/^worktree //')"
CONFIG="$PRIMARY/.github/merge-bot.json"
[ -n "$PRIMARY" ] && [ -f "$CONFIG" ] \
  || { echo "no per-checkout config at $CONFIG (copy .github/merge-bot.json.example there)"; exit 1; }
BOT_SLUG=$(jq -r .appSlug "$CONFIG")
[ -n "$BOT_SLUG" ] && [ "$BOT_SLUG" != null ] \
  || { echo "appSlug missing from $CONFIG"; exit 1; }
BOT_ID=$(gh api "users/${BOT_SLUG}%5Bbot%5D" --jq .id)
[ -n "$BOT_ID" ] && [ "$BOT_ID" != null ] \
  || { echo "no bot user id for ${BOT_SLUG}[bot] from the GitHub API"; exit 1; }

git config user.name  "${BOT_SLUG}[bot]"
git config user.email "${BOT_ID}+${BOT_SLUG}[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
```

Derive the id, never transcribe it — the address embeds the **bot user id**, not the
app id, the two sit near each other in the docs, and the wrong one produces an
address that resolves to no GitHub user at all. A literal id copied into a document
is a second copy of a fact that already lives somewhere authoritative, and the copy
is the one that goes stale: the identity produced by this sequence is correct by
construction, one transcribed by hand was wrong for days. Because there is exactly
one copy, fixing it cures every worktree at once.

Committer and author are different identities by owner ruling: the **committer** is
the acting agent (the config above); the **author** is the human whose authority the
work carries, passed per commit —
`git commit --author="Jim Cresswell <1314980+jimCresswell@users.noreply.github.com>" -F <msg>`.
The default is deliberately fail-safe: forget the flag and you get a bot-authored
commit, never a commit that silently credits the owner with agent work.

### 3. Make the worktree buildable

This step applies to execution-capable profiles only. In a detected ChatGPT
Work cloud session, step 0 forbids it; missing dependencies or build output do
not trigger provisioning.

```bash
pnpm --dir <path> install
pnpm --dir <path> build
```

Both scoped to the worktree with `--dir`, because this step runs before entry, from the
principal: an unscoped `pnpm install` there rebuilds the principal and leaves the new
worktree without its dependencies or `dist/`. Both, before any gate, work or entry:
`type-check` and `vitest` pass on install alone,
but the internal ESLint plugin resolves to `dist/`, so an unbuilt worktree fails `lint`
with `No exports main defined`. A fresh worktree has **no `.env.local`** — copy it from
a worktree that has one when the lane runs anything env-dependent (codegen, ingest, a
local server). Data directories that are gitignored (bulk downloads) do not travel
either; fetch them per the owning workflow rather than copying, so their manifest
vintage stays honest.

### 4. Establish residency — or decide not to enter

In detected ChatGPT Work cloud, operate through the tool's explicit `workdir`
or absolute paths. Do not invoke Claude's `EnterWorktree`; continue at step 5.

The platform asks the human for approval on every `EnterWorktree` to a path outside
`.claude/worktrees/`, and no permission rule or "don't ask again" suppresses it
([Claude Code worktrees documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/worktrees),
since v2.1.206). So the session-level switch is an owner-present step: first say the
exact invocation you are about to issue — as a directed event to the Director where a
Director is live; in a solo session, in the reply the owner is reading, immediately
before the call — then issue `EnterWorktree` with the path only when the owner is known
to be at the keyboard. A prompt nobody answers holds the seat until someone does, while its
heartbeat loop keeps reading fresh (nine hours on 2026-09-07/08). When the owner may be
away, do not enter: operate the worktree non-resident from the principal (`git -C <path>`
for git, the platform's file-editing tool on absolute paths for edits, one plain command
per call — not residency, and named as such in the lane broadcast), or have the session
launched inside the worktree (`cd <path> && claude`), which prompts for nothing
([`worktree-residency`](../../rules/worktree-residency.md) clause 2). A bare `cd` is not
residency and does not survive; a `Shell cwd was reset` line means it did not take. Arm
monitors where you reside: at the principal before an entry, or inside the worktree once
resident — the resident arm roots its `cd` at the worktree and passes the supervisor pid
as a literal, because the isolation guard refuses runtime-computed values such as
`$PPID`; verify each monitor after any switch and re-arm what died from where you are.
The arm shapes and the guard's checks are in
[`worktree-residency`](../../rules/worktree-residency.md) clause 4.

### 5. Verify before trusting it

In the ChatGPT Work cloud profile, verify only the branch, explicit base,
story-only diff, exact changed-file set and static file/link invariants. The
identity and attribution rows below belong to the standard profile, and no
local runtime or full-gate claim is made.

| Check | Command | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity resolves in the worktree | `git -C <path> config user.email` | the bot address above |
| Nothing shadows the shared copy | `git -C <path> config --worktree --get-regexp '^user\.'` | no output |
| Base is clean | `git -C <path> log --oneline origin/<base>..HEAD` | only this story's commits |
| Attribution is right | `git -C <path> log -1 --format='%an / %cn'` | author human, committer bot |

The second row is not optional, and a green first row cannot stand in for it. A
`--worktree` override holding the *same* value reads correct today and silently keeps
the stale one the day the shared config is corrected — which is how a single wrong id
came to sit in nine places at once.

### 6. First push carries a draft PR

Every pushed branch carries at least a draft PR from its first push
(`worktree-hygiene` §1). Push from the worktree, not the principal — the principal's
hooks gate the whole tree, so one seat's dirty file blocks every seat — and give the
push a **600s timeout**, because the 120s default kills the hook suite mid-run and
leaves an ambiguous write.

Before any push that changes a vocabulary, an order or a bound — a renamed term, a
re-sequenced step, a re-scoped rule — read every surface that carries it (the touched
files' siblings, the rules and skills they cite, the adapters and index rows) and cure
them in the same push; derive the terms from the change's own before→after words,
never from a reviewer's. This is the review-round tally instrument's practice half:
its absence cost one records PR eight rounds (2026-09-08), each round the next
surface the reviewer sampled.

In a detected ChatGPT Work cloud session, use `HUSKY=0` for any local git
commit or push and the configured default credential; when shell transport has
no configured credential, use the already-authenticated GitHub connector. Open
the draft PR immediately and treat only a concluded `run-quality-gates` check
on that head as execution evidence. Static inspection is reported separately,
never as a local-gate result.

## Failure shapes this procedure exists to prevent

- **Attribution that resolves to nobody** (2026-08-04). The shared config carried the
  app id in the commit email, and worktree-scoped copies masked the fault unevenly —
  some worktrees right, the rest broken, with no surface reporting the split. It
  surfaced only as a Vercel deployment warning — "Invalid git email address / No
  matching user / Vercel Account: Unavailable" — days after the drift. The cure is
  structural and now doctrine: one copy in the shared config, so a correction cannot
  be half-applied. Ticket MCP-490 tracks making the check mechanical.
- **The contaminated base** (PR #673). Fresh-mode branch creation from the
  principal's HEAD; the lane PR carried coordination commits; cost a close-recreate.
- **The gate that blames the wrong thing** (2026-08-04). `PNPM_HOME` on a machine may
  point at a directory that does not hold the `pnpm` binary, so the hook's *nested*
  pnpm call fails its trusted-location check and the pre-commit gate reports
  "formatting issues" for a checker that never ran. If a gate blames formatting on a
  file you have just formatted, read the gate's own output before believing it.
  **Never re-point `PNPM_HOME` to make the gate run** — pnpm derives its store root
  from `PNPM_HOME` (`pnpm store path` proves it), so a re-pointed value silently
  creates a second store and rebinds every tree it installs into; every default-env
  pnpm run in such a tree then demands a destructive modules purge
  (`ERR_PNPM_ABORTED_REMOVE_MODULES_DIR_NO_TTY`), and auto-confirming that with
  `CI=true` is a bypass (owner ruling 2026-08-04). A wrong `PNPM_HOME` is an
  environment misconfiguration: surface it to the owner and fix the value itself;
  worked instance 2026-08-04 (two trees rebound to an accidental
  `$PNPM_HOME/store`, a fleet-wide write freeze, and a two-workaround stack that
  each hid the other's cause).
