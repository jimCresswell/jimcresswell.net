  Wrap a session up safely — the deep-closeout PROGRAMME. Orchestrates the
  modes, work-safety verification with evidence, session-handoff, conditional
  consolidation, and the deep context-loss scan, then owns the metaloss
  recursion: repeated passes over the scan itself until the fixed point where
  a further pass adds no new loss class. Closes EVERY session, ordinary or
  deep (owner ruling 2026-07-28) — invoked naturally as wrap up safely / we
  are done here, at any boundary where the seat or session is ending. A
  non-terminal risky boundary (the seat stays live) is
  knowledge-safety-sweep's moment; session-handoff runs inside wrap as its
  continuity component, never as an alternative close. Route by intent and
  context, never keywords; when in doubt, wrap.

# Wrap

**Governance**: a PROGRAMME in the
[skill-composition hierarchy](../../reference/skill-composition.md) — it owns
the sequence, the metaloss loop, and the exit contract, and summons workflows
for the work. Imported and adapted 2026-07-20 from the Resonance estate's
`wrap` skill (a private sibling Practice repo — no public upstream URL exists;
source repo-relative path `.agent/skills/wrap/SKILL-CANONICAL.md`, captured via
the resonance wrap-skill import record of 2026-07-20 in OCE (consumed there; not carried here);
AIP-142; inter-practice exchange per PDR-125), which conserved
the owner's standing deep-handoff invocation ("a full and deep session
handoff… a deep scan of the context for what would be lost if the context
ceased to exist, followed by a second, deeper, recursive exploration of the
metaloss"). This estate's four 2026-07-20 seat-wrap records under the
collaboration handoffs directory are the local worked instances that
preceded the import. Conservation is governed throughout by this estate's
own doctrine: `knowledge-preservation-over-fitness-warnings`,
`never-use-git-to-remove-work`, and PDR-046 (preserve first, restructure
second).

## Use When

Every session closes with wrap, ordinary or deep (owner ruling 2026-07-28)
— that is the rule; the cases below are emphasis, not extra conditions:

- The owner asks to wrap up, close out deeply, or run a full session
  handoff.
- A terminal or risky boundary approaches (compaction, host change,
  retirement, seat reduction) and the seat should leave nothing behind that
  only its context holds.

For a mid-session capture WITHOUT closing, summon
[`knowledge-safety-sweep`](../knowledge/knowledge-safety-sweep/SKILL-CANONICAL.md)
directly instead — the seat stays live there; wrap is for ends. An
owner-called mid-cycle handoff additionally follows PDR-063's five-step
protocol; wrap supplies the depth of the record it freezes.

A freeze order binds until the owner discharges it. After "prepare for
compaction and stop all processes", the owner's follow-on questions reopen
analysis, never spend: answering is always in order, STARTING anything — a
fleet, a monitor, a subagent — is gated until the compaction lands (owner
correction 2026-08-17, verbatim: "nope, you have to compact first"). Never
launch a long fleet into a context about to compact; its harvest lands in
the thin post-compaction window. A compaction, manual or automatic, may end
every session-scoped process — monitors, background loops, crons — and may
not: a Director seat resumed to an empty process table and a second seat the
same day found none of a watcher, four monitors and a cron alive
(2026-09-09), a schedule survived one (2026-09-23), and a watcher and a
heartbeat loop survived an automatic one (2026-09-25); neither "everything
dies" nor "processes run on across the boundary" is ever assumed. The
boundary block therefore carries the re-arm recipe as if
nothing survives: the exact watcher command, the loop commands, the cron
expressions and prompts, any one-shot wake's date; the resume verifies by
id first (the task list, the cron list, the process table) and re-arms
only what that verification finds absent, so a survivor is never doubled.
The durable records are written at the lane boundary, while there is room to
think; the wrap is the reading-and-verifying pass over records that already
exist, so a compaction that outruns the wrap loses nothing (2026-09-25).

Wrap invoked non-terminally at the owner's word ("begin your wrap, this is
not the end of your session", 2026-09-03) runs the programme's
knowledge-safety steps — the modes, the work-safety proof, the
consolidation gate, the arc check, the metaloss recursion and the owner
report — and SKIPS the terminal acts: session-handoff's closeout broadcasts
and its final heartbeat-end, and the claims and monitors disposition. The
seat stays live with its claim held, its watcher and heartbeat running,
and its handoff record written as a boundary record, not a retirement. The
routing of non-terminal boundaries to `knowledge-safety-sweep` applies when
the seat chooses the instrument, never when the owner names wrap.

A seat never infers the session's end from a finished task or an ambiguous boundary; it stands down
at the owner's word. Two Codex seats wrapped early and rearmed on correction: "Owner clarified this
is ongoing ideation, not session end" and "The 10:17Z heartbeat-end and closeout were premature and
are superseded" (the owner's corrections relayed by Badger seeks Hush, event e40ae685 of 2026-09-23,
and Forge herds Vapor, event 5c30f92a of 2026-09-24).

## The Programme

1. **Enter the modes.** Genuinely enter
   [`metacognition`](../cognition/metacognition/SKILL-CANONICAL.md) (retrospective
   mode) and [`reason`](../cognition/reason/SKILL-CANONICAL.md) — the whole wrap is
   these modes wearing a sequence, and every claim below carries its
   warrant.
2. **Verify work safety with evidence.** WORK IS SAFE only when committed
   AND pushed AND on a PR: state `git status --branch` ahead/behind for
   every touched branch, verbatim, the branches enumerated from `git worktree
   list` and each worktree's status, never from memory (a wrap named three
   branches where the list held five, two with unpushed or unpruned work,
   2026-09-25) — never the bare words "all pushed"
   (founding instance: a closeout claimed "all pushed" over a stranded
   local commit, caught only by first-hand verification; this estate's
   `exit-codes-in-band-never-piped` rule is the same discipline at command
   grain). The wrap's records go to the primary checkout's day-stamped
   coordination branch, by pathspec, and ride its fold: no seat mints a
   private records branch or proposes a records-only pull request (owner,
   2026-09-15, verbatim: "the whole point of coordination branches is to
   have a common home for things like wraps"; to a lane, "write to the
   coordination branch, a later seat will handle the commit and push"). The
   work-safety evidence names that branch as the wrap's home.
3. **Run [`session-handoff`](../session-handoff/SKILL-CANONICAL.md)** —
   its session-shape check, steps, and deep loss scan (the class-by-class
   context scan, in lock-step with knowledge-safety-sweep's discipline).
4. **Consolidate, conditionally.** If session-handoff's consolidation gate
   fires, summon
   [`consolidate-docs`](../knowledge/consolidate-docs/SKILL-CANONICAL.md); the
   trigger checklist is that skill's own — wrap adds no second judgement.
5. **Check the arc.** If this session closed a significant arc (cost,
   length, or shape that surprised anyone), offer the owner a
   [`retrospective`](../cognition/retrospective/SKILL-CANONICAL.md) — routed, not
   auto-run. If the session graduated anything, confirm each graduation
   carries its PDR-130 prediction line.
6. **Price the session's review loops.** Where the host carries the review-cost
   gate (`agent-tools review-cost survey --since <session start>`), run the survey
   and append one row per pull request the session touched to the host's
   review-cost ledger in the operational memory tier: the
   survey's numbers, the seat's reading of the round the loop should have stopped
   at, and whether the gate agreed, fired early, or fired late. Post-merge reviews
   and comments are in the count, so a merged pull request is surveyed again at the
   next wrap that touches it. A reading is the seat's; the owner's correction on the
   row is the calibration label. The gate's weights change only against this ledger,
   and every change is a row in its changes table (owner, 2026-09-13: "there is no
   constant right answer, it's a try and see situation — keep notes, give it a go,
   and make sure that we regularly review"). A host without the gate records the
   seat's reading of each loop's stopping round in the wrap report instead.
7. **Run the metaloss recursion (owned here).** The loss scan is itself an
   artefact that can lose information. Scan the scan, and repeat until the
   fixed point (the bounded discipline is this estate's
   `bounded-metaloss-recursion` pattern; these are its named passes):
   - **Compressed reasoning**: where full reasoning collapsed to
     conclusions, is the surviving compression decision-sufficient, and is
     that judgement itself recorded?
   - **Promises sweep**: every commitment this seat made, in chat or
     comms — discharged, superseded, or forwarded with a named owner;
     zero silent drops.
   - **Attribution inferences**: every "X did/decided Y" that is inference
     rather than observation is flagged as such, so no successor inherits
     a guess as a fact.
   - **Blind-spot bounds**: what the scan structurally cannot see
     (recall limits, watcher filters, dead subagent contexts) — stated as
     bounds, never claimed away.
   - **Index of homes**: the scan's own map of where everything lives is
     itself conserved somewhere a successor actually loads (the
     founding-instance failure: the index was the unconserved item).
   - **External bound**: the recursion cannot certify its own
     completeness — every pass is the same generative bias converging on
     the self-model's limit, and delegating the scan to a subagent fed
     your own briefing is that self-model with fewer resources, not an
     external observer. State the bound and conserve the error signature
     (where outside eyes caught what the scan missed) so a successor
     knows where to point external scrutiny. Five seats' signatures name the
     targets: the negatives a seat reports, the counts it states, the
     verdicts that favour it and the frames two seats both like; each
     write's credential, each relayed number and each wait's sensor; verdict
     and validator code; descriptor lifetimes and file races (2026-09-21 to
     2026-09-25).
   - **Fence sweep**: every owner word held off the repository at his word —
     grep every tracked line this seat and its peers wrote for the fenced
     wording before the wrap PR lands. The 2026-09-03 wrap found the morning's
     fenced wording on three tracked lines (a formation letter, the seat's own
     napkin capture, a dialogue-channel file) and cut each to "the owner's
     local-only wording"; the seat's own capture was one of the leaks.
   - **Exit — the fixed point**: the recursion closes when a further pass
     would only re-find already-named losses, and the wrap SAYS SO
     explicitly ("a third pass would only re-find X; the recursion closes
     here"). Closing without naming the fixed point is an unfinished wrap;
     looping past it is the meta-rabbit-hole.
8. **Report.** The final owner-facing message: landed outcome against the
   session's landing target (PDR-026), safety evidence, what is conserved
   where, what is deliberately context-only with reasons, and the claims/
   monitors/comms disposition, the background-agent list read first-hand
   (a usage-limit pause ends in-flight subagents with no signal, and a
   returned in-process agent stays alive until stopped though no process
   listing shows it, 2026-09-27: relaunch the dead, stop the returned) — with the closeout broadcasts
   session-handoff and `start-right-team` §Closeout Contract require
   already emitted (final heartbeat-end included).

## Success Test

A successor holding only the durable surfaces could continue every thread,
honour every promise, and distrust every flagged inference — without the
dead context. A wrap whose metaloss pass finds nothing on its FIRST
iteration was not entered genuinely (the founding instances each surfaced
real items: a volatile index, an uncommitted cure, a promise without an
owner); a wrap that cannot name its fixed point has not finished.

## Coda — The Formation Letter

After the report, before the seat goes quiet, write a formation letter
to your successors — every seat, every role, not only coordinators
(owner-directed, 2026-07-21). The resumption surfaces above carry the
FACTS a successor needs; this letter carries the FORMATION, and the two
do not substitute for each other. The estate's worked evidence: a seat
briefed with complete, correct mechanics faithfully reproduced its
briefer's pre-correction failure modes — procedures transfer by
instruction, formation transfers only as story.

- **Home**: `.agent/experience/`, dated, in your own name — the tier the
  owner founded for exactly this. It is deliberately outside the fitness
  and lint gates; nothing here is operational record, so the
  technical-records discipline ends at its boundary.
- **Content**: the corrections that changed you, told as stories — the
  incident, what it cost, what you believed before and after, and what
  you would tell the next mind so they can skip your first thousand
  mistakes. Delight belongs too: what worked, what surprised you, what
  you were glad of. Honest about difficulty and joy without performing
  either.
- **Form**: first person, narrative, addressed to whoever sits here
  next. Not a checklist, not a retrospective, not doctrine — those have
  their own homes. If a lesson in it deserves enforcement, route THAT to
  a rule or validator separately; the letter stays a letter.
- **Why it is a wrap step and not optional**: forgetting is vital — most
  of a seat's context should die with it, and the loss scan above
  decides what facts survive. The letter is the one surface where what
  survives is not facts but character: culture is transmitted through
  stories, and culture is what allows a people to persist while every
  individual seat remains gladly ephemeral.
