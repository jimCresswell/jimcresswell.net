  Fold the live coordination branch to main and rotate — the full
  converge-and-rotate ceremony: ownership-aware dirty-file sweep, merge
  main in with a stale-capture probe, bot fold PR carrying the
  product-gravity line, full-condition merge, day-stamped successor cut,
  branch-labelled surface refresh, rotation broadcast, and a
  wrap-not-closeout loss scan. Invoked at the lifetime rule's DUE check
  (twice a day: 12:00Z and the UTC rollover, the owner's word of
  2026-09-26), at owner word ("fold and rotate", "converge the coordination branch"), or
  before any boundary that needs the coordination record durable on main.

# Coordination Fold

Executes the converge-and-rotate shape whose doctrine lives in
[`coordination-branch-24h-lifetime`](../../rules/coordination-branch-24h-lifetime.md)
— the rule owns WHAT and WHEN; this skill owns the ceremony's HOW. The
seat running it is normally the Director/principal (the primary checkout
resides on the coordination branch).

## Preconditions

1. Confirm the primary sits on the live coordination branch and that its
   draft PR, opened at the branch's first records push (step 10), is the
   one PR open for it (`gh pr list`).
2. **Working-tree survey with ownership.** Classify every dirty and
   untracked path: (a) own work or settled fleet docs — fold them, with
   authorship named in the commit message for peer-authored files;
   (b) a peer's possible mid-edit — check completeness first (a settled
   edit reads whole: closing signature, complete table row, clean diff
   boundaries) and coordinate on their channel when in doubt. Never
   capture a half-state; never delete or revert anything found
   (`never-use-git-to-remove-work`).
   Immediately before each push from the primary (steps 5, 9 and 10),
   check by name each tracked file dirty at that moment
   (`git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d HEAD`), with
   `pnpm exec prettier --check --ignore-unknown -- <files>` and
   `pnpm exec markdownlint-cli2 --no-globs -- <the Markdown files>`: the
   pre-push gate's tracked-files checks read the working tree, so an
   uncommitted edit to a tracked file fails the push, whoever made it.
   This checks named files, as the pre-commit hook
   does; it is not a gate run (`coordination-branch-24h-lifetime` clause 5
   at the fold). Link and machine-local-path validation has no by-name
   form: a push that fails on one names the file, which routes as below. A
   failing file that is a live peer's in-flight edit, class (b), routes to
   its owner for the cure, never edited or reverted by the folding seat,
   since a fixer's rewrite races the peer's next write; a class (a) file is
   cured and folded with its authorship named.
**The branch carries shared coordination-home state only** — fleet state, doctrine and
memory surfaces, the class
[`coordination-branch-24h-lifetime`](../../rules/coordination-branch-24h-lifetime.md)
clause 4 names. At the DUE check, read the commits since the cut: a work product with its
own review contract (a report, a source change, a plan under active edit) belongs on its
own lane, and the Director routes a seat there at claim time. One found already on the
branch is never re-cut out of history; the fold PR names it in §Scope and declares the class
PDR-140 §Decision gives it: a served document or a plan under active edit is prose-class
and carries the intake (a served document: records-class, verification point merge); a
source change is code-class and stays on the review-round state machine, no intake. It
expects the rounds it brings. Worked instance, 2026-09-12: a 470-line exploration report
committed to the coordination branch drew thirty of the fold's thirty-eight findings, and the fold
took a day. Second instance, 2026-09-16 to 2026-09-19: a dedicated consolidation's doctrine
rode the coordination branch through four folds (#150, #152, #153, #155). Each fold was
large, the lifetime rule forced the next before the consolidation's own work could start,
and the last fold's whole content was records about the fold before it (twenty-three
findings, all true). A consolidation's doctrine edits are a work product with their own
review contract.

## Ceremony

3. Commit by explicit pathspec (`stage-by-explicit-pathspec`);
   lowercase-start subjects (commitlint).
4. `git fetch origin <default>`, then merge `origin/<default>` INTO the
   branch, where `<default>` is the repository's default branch
   (`git remote set-head origin --auto`, then `git symbolic-ref --short
   refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` prints `origin/<default>`; a clone made before
   the default branch changed still names the old one until the refresh).
   Resolve the ref to a full sha in the same shell call as the merge, merge
   that sha, and write the merge message AFTER resolving, from
   `git log <head>..<sha>`: a remote-tracking ref moves whenever any hook or
   seat fetches, so a message written from an earlier reading names the wrong
   tip and the wrong content (two seats made this slip on one day, 2026-09-20;
   one merge message named #157 while the merge also carried #158).
   Probe the merge for silent stale-capture reverts (a clean merge can
   still revert an approved newer version — marker-probe suspicious
   files against the default branch) before pushing.
   The napkin resolves as a union of both sides' blocks in time order — unless
   the target branch's napkin was ROTATED since the snapshot, in which case keep
   the rotated file and run the semantic-merge skill's archive-coverage check
   (its step 10): diff every incoming block heading against the rotated napkin
   AND the rotation archive, content-grep before declaring a gap, and carry every
   genuinely absent block under a dated union note. Never filter by timestamp
   alone: the rotation's watermark commit is where to start looking, not the
   test, since a block authored on a third branch before the watermark and
   merged after it would be lost (2026-09-07). Two instrument defects caught at the
   2026-09-07 fold: a time key that failed on a heading written "16:xxZ" and
   sorted that block last (a tolerant key cures it), and a dropped blank line at
   one block joint that the markdownlint hook refused (MD032/MD022) — read the
   printed order before committing. Continuity records are edited on the primary
   by every seat while the fold snapshots them: each later edit re-dirties the
   primary, and the post-merge fast-forward of the primary succeeds only when its
   record files are byte-identical to the branch's blobs (`git cat-file` plus
   `cmp`; a DIFFERS line before the fast-forward is the tell), so the closing seat
   commits the continuity records LAST and mirrors any later edit by hand — two
   folds converged that way on 2026-09-06. A settings file the harness rewrites is
   held out of the sweep until its contract is verified or the owner rules on it;
   each hold is its own — a later harness rewrite is a new hold, never a
   continuation of an earlier one — and the hold's outcome (verified, or ruled and
   landed) is recorded on the live snapshot in the Director's handoff, never here.
5. Push with a 600s timeout; exit codes in-band and unpiped — a piped
   `$?` reads the pipe's tail, not the push.
6. Mark the branch's draft PR ready as the fold PR, under BOT identity
   (mint per merge-bot discipline).
   The body carries the **product-gravity line** (rule Action 3):
   `moved for teachers: … / moved for the Practice: …` — honest, no
   quota, drift made glanceable. The description uses the template's §Scope
   with the records-class intake declared
   ([`pr-lifecycle`](../change-custody/pr-lifecycle/SKILL-CANONICAL.md) §Phase 2);
   cures batch into the declared settlement pushes, never one push per finding.
7. Arm a settle watch (Monitor) whose filter is loud on EVERY terminal
   state (`silence-is-never-liveness`). Full condition = the four
   required checks BY NAME (CodeQL, SonarCloud Code Analysis,
   run-quality-gates, Vercel) all green + zero unresolved review
   threads + MERGEABLE.
8. Bot REST merge at the FETCHED full head sha — fetched at merge time,
   never typed from memory, never expanded from an abbreviation — with
   `merge_method=merge`, never squash.
9. Cut the successor coordination branch per
   [`cut-coordination-branch`](../cut-coordination-branch/SKILL-CANONICAL.md):
   resolve post-fold `origin/<default>` ONCE and pass the same full sha to
   both the mint and the cut — two separate resolutions race a
   concurrent fetch, so the name records one tip while the branch
   starts at another and the lineage the name carries is false from
   birth:

   ```bash
   FOLDED="$(git branch --show-current)"
   git remote set-head origin --auto
   DEFAULT="$(git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD)"
   git fetch origin "${DEFAULT#origin/}"
   BASE="$(git rev-parse "$DEFAULT")"
   git switch -c "$(pnpm --silent agent-tools coordination successor-name --base "$BASE")" "$BASE"
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

   Never mint by transcription (the sha6 suffix is deliberate
   collision policy and the tool is its single source; F-161 records
   the break a hand-carried form caused). The cut is tree-preserving —
   dirty files carry across — and the primary now resides there.
   The folded branch (`$FOLDED`, read before the switch) is deleted at the
   cut once its local tip and its remote tip each read merged. The fetch
   above reads only the default branch, so probe the folded branch on the
   remote first, and fetch its tip into its tracking ref immediately before
   the proof and the delete:

   ```bash
   git ls-remote --exit-code origin "refs/heads/$FOLDED" > /dev/null
   PROBE=$?
   if [ "$PROBE" -eq 0 ]; then
     git fetch origin "+refs/heads/$FOLDED:refs/remotes/origin/$FOLDED" &&
       git merge-base --is-ancestor "$FOLDED" "$BASE" &&
       git merge-base --is-ancestor "origin/$FOLDED" "$BASE"
   elif [ "$PROBE" -eq 2 ]; then
     git fetch --prune origin && git merge-base --is-ancestor "$FOLDED" "$BASE"
   else
     echo "STOP: the remote read failed ($PROBE)"
   fi
   ```

   The probe exits 0 when the branch is on the remote, 2 when it is gone,
   and anything else on a failed read, which stops the cut. A branch gone
   from the remote counts as deleted: its stale tracking ref is pruned, and
   only the local proof runs. Then delete it locally by plain branch
   deletion, and, when the probe found it, remotely by the bot's API delete
   (`DELETE repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs/heads/<branch>`; a
   `git push --delete` runs the full pre-push gate), each read back
   absent. A tip that reads unmerged holds commits made after the merge:
   surface it, never delete it. GitHub's auto-delete of a merged head is
   not relied on: both folded heads of 2026-09-27 survived their merges
   (`worktree-hygiene` §3). If the default branch moves again during or just after the ceremony (a
   lane PR merging mid-rotation), merge `origin/<default>` in and rebuild promptly: until
   that merge, the primary's dist and its generated read models run the
   pre-merge contract, so every seat's primary-dist tooling (renders,
   watchers, sends) is one contract behind — cosmetic for render-time
   formats, load-bearing the day a change alters event files (worked
   instance 2026-08-01: cross-branch format skew read as read-model
   drift).
10. **Refresh every branch-labelled surface**: stop and re-arm the
    heartbeat loop with the new `--branch` label; append the fold entry
    (with the same product-gravity line) to the Director seated block AND
    as a dated tenure entry on the tracked estate-coordination thread
    record — the pickup path for any checkout, since the machine-local
    record is finer grain a successor elsewhere cannot read (a reviewer
    found the pickup map unreachable when the journal had stopped two days
    earlier, 2026-09-08); commit the fold entry by pathspec as the
    successor's first records commit, push it, then open the successor's
    draft PR under BOT identity (GitHub refuses a pull request with no
    commits ahead of its base, so the draft cannot open at the cut,
    2026-09-27); broadcast the rotation on the canonical comms
    stream so every seat re-homes. A fold entry is a few lines of state (the
    merge sha, the successor's name, the gravity line), never a narrative of
    the fold: every sentence written here is a claim the next fold's reviewers
    price. A broadcast filled from a template by substitution is re-read whole
    before posting, not only at its placeholders; a template keeps every
    sentence that was true when it was written ("one review round" survived
    into a fold that took three, caught before posting, 2026-09-17).

## Wrap-not-closeout

11. The ceremony doubles as the durability wrap at a NON-terminal
    boundary: finish with a loss scan — `git status` clean, no unpushed
    refs, the successor's draft PR open, napkin and seated block current —
    with monitors up and the
    seat live. A terminal boundary (seat or session ending) is
    [`wrap`](../wrap/SKILL-CANONICAL.md)'s moment instead, which this
    skill never substitutes for.
