# Validation Strategy

The validation estate of this repository, from the compiler outward: the
compile-time type flow, runtime validation at every boundary, the deterministic
gates, and the evaluate / assure layers above them. It operationalises
[principles.md §Compiler Time Types and Runtime Validation](principles.md#compiler-time-types-and-runtime-validation)
and §Agentic Quality, and it is the formal home the
[testing-strategy.md](testing-strategy.md) doctrine points to for mutation checks.
The spine (test / evaluate / assure) and the assurance tiers are ratified (owner,
2026-06-23); the finer eval taxonomy is deliberately deferred until the first eval
suites in this repository produce real experience to write from.

## The spine: test / evaluate / assure

- **Test** — _deterministic_. Proves code does what its spec says. Binary,
  reproducible; unit of truth is the assertion, and a test uses no IO.
  [testing-strategy.md](testing-strategy.md) defines the tests, and the E2E and
  smoke checks beside them, which are validation surfaces. Mutation checks (§Prove the guard
  bites, below) are the meta-quality layer that makes test coverage meaningful.
- **Evaluate** — _probabilistic_. Measures the value and reliability of a
  judgement-laden capability across realistic inputs, graded relative to a
  baseline. Unit of truth is a graded outcome over a corpus plus a with/without
  delta. Assertions are authored _after_ the first run (this inverts test-first).
  For a Practice skill the delta is read from the evidence its eval runner
  retains under the skill's `evals/results/` (the result per arm, every trace
  and answer, a manifest of the evaluated versions); OCE's instrument is
  `agent-tools skill-evals`, documented in its `agent-tools/README.md`.
- **Assure** — the umbrella trust case: composes test + evaluate + conformance +
  UAT + observability + security review + human review into ongoing evidence that
  the capability is fit for the world.

**Describe the outcome you want; never audit the implementation choice** is the
continuity across all three — the same discipline as "test behaviour, not
implementation" in testing.

## Assurance tiers (risk-tiered, keyed on harm asymmetry)

Rigour is proportionate to the harm of getting it wrong — not uniform, and not
keyed on surface type.

| Tier | Applies to | Assurance floor |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Asymmetric, hard-to-reverse harm to a person — a public claim about a real person or organisation, evidence surfaced or summarised, advice that attributes | Tests + strict schema validation at the boundary + human review of the rendered claim; mandatory evals with a faithfulness assertion where a judgement-laden capability produces it |
| **Standard** | User-facing where errors are visible and correctable — page composition, navigation, metadata, a search or tool surface | Tests + E2E checks + rendered proof or conformance + behavioural evals where the surface is judgement-laden |
| **Light** | Internal / agent-facing where harm is cheap and self-correcting — formatting, scaffolding, Practice tooling | Tests + spot checks; evals optional |

The host's instances of each tier are in §This host's bindings.

## Compile-time types: preserve information, never widen

Type precision is one expression of strict, complete, schema-driven practice. The
type flow is `external input → validation → known types → strictly typed system`.
The ONLY function that takes `unknown` (or otherwise-untyped) input is the boundary
validator, which narrows to known types; **past that boundary nothing widens**.

- **No type widening or destruction** — never use widening casts (`as SomeType`),
  `any`, `!`, `Record<string, unknown>`, `{ [key: string]: unknown }`, `Object.*`
  methods, `Reflect.*` methods, `isObject` type predicates, `z.unknown()` where a
  concrete schema exists, `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())`, or hand-crafted Zod
  schemas that duplicate a shape the entity schema already declares. `as const` and
  `satisfies SomeType` are permitted because they tighten compile-time information
  instead of disabling it
  ([principles.md §Type precision](principles.md#compiler-time-types-and-runtime-validation)).
- **`unknown` is type destruction** — `unknown`, `z.unknown()` and
  `Record<string, unknown>` erase structural type information. They are permitted
  only at named external boundaries and are forbidden as stand-ins for known
  shapes (§The `unknown` boundary exception, below).
- **Never widen literal types** into broad annotations such as `string` or
  `number` — including a `Set<string>` or a `readonly string[]` view over an
  `as const`-derived value to make a lookup type-check. Widening is information
  loss and a deferred bug. **Any widening is an immediate stop-and-reassess
  trigger**: trace to the exact domain type — the strict cure is almost always the
  precise union (`Set<DeclaredPhase>`) or a zero-widening membership check
  (`ids.some((id) => id === value)`), never a `string` view.
- **Single source of truth for types** — define each type once, preferably by
  inference from the schema that validates it (`z.infer<typeof Schema>` in the
  module that owns the schema) or from the library that owns it, then import it
  everywhere. Never redefine it later as an approximation.
- **Use library types directly** — do not invent a local type when a package
  exports the type you need; prefer official error classes and response types over
  local `*Like` shapes, introducing a local shape only when the library exposes
  nothing usable.
- **Type imports must be labelled with `type`** — `import type { T } from 'x'` or
  `import { type T } from 'x'`.
- **Avoid type-alias entropy** — do not introduce aliases that merely rename an
  inferred, library, or well-named local type. Good naming and direct imports keep
  the concept graph smaller.

### The constant-type-predicate pattern

The foundational type pattern of this codebase:

1. Define runtime constants with `as const`.
2. Derive strict types with `typeof ... [number]`.
3. Create type predicate functions backed by honest runtime checks.
4. Optionally use `satisfies` to prove interface compliance without losing literal
   types.

```typescript
const ALLOWED_COLORS = ['red', 'green', 'blue'] as const;
type AllowedColor = (typeof ALLOWED_COLORS)[number];

function isAllowedColor(color: string): color is AllowedColor {
  // Zero-widening membership: narrow by equality over the exactly-typed constant.
  return ALLOWED_COLORS.some((allowed) => allowed === color);
}
// Forbidden: a `readonly string[]` view or `new Set<string>(ALLOWED_COLORS).has(color)`
// — both widen the constant's literal type to `string`.
```

### Compile-time validation patterns

- **`as const satisfies T`** is the gold standard for data that must be both a
  literal type and structurally valid. `as const` alone preserves literals but skips
  structural checks; `satisfies` alone checks structure but widens literals.
  Combined, you get both:

  ```typescript
  const c = { name: 'search' } as const satisfies { name: string };
  // type: { readonly name: 'search' } — literal preserved + structural check
  ```

- **Type predicate stubs** — with `noUnusedParameters`, `() => false` will not
  compile as a type predicate stub. Use the parameter in the body:
  `(v: unknown): v is T => typeof v === 'string' && v === '__never__'`.
- **Compile-time type assertions** (`AssertNoX<T>`) are inert unless the resulting
  type is consumed in a binding or type path. Always bind the assertion result.
- **Spread with optional properties widens**: `{ ...defaults, ...overrides }` where
  `overrides.prop?: T` yields `prop: T | undefined` even when `defaults.prop: T`.
  Fix with explicit property resolution using `??` or a typed merge helper.
- **Discriminated unions** of `readonly string[] | { excludes: readonly string[] }`
  narrow with `'excludes' in value` (property check), not `Array.isArray(value)` —
  `Array.isArray` narrows to `string[]` but leaves the else branch still containing
  both union members.

### Derive views from the schema, never restate them

A hand-restated projection of an inferred type is a **shadow schema** — it drifts
silently when the contract evolves. When a consumer needs a narrowed view of an
entity type, derive it (`Partial<Pick<Entity, 'fieldA' | 'fieldB'>>` or indexed
access such as `NonNullable<Entity['sameAs']>`), never re-declare the fields by
hand; deriving keeps the consumable shape identical and turns contract drift into a
compile error. Verify field shapes against the SCHEMA, not a handoff note — a
relayed note once mis-stated a list of objects as strings (worked instance
2026-07-01). When a test fake cannot satisfy a complex inferred type without `as`,
extract a narrowed interface containing only the fields the code under test
consumes — interface segregation removes the assertion pressure at source rather
than working around it.

The detailed TypeScript and tooling quirks (runtime value typing, lint
interactions, collation, test doubles) live in the TypeScript gotchas reference
the host declares (§This host's bindings).

## Runtime validation at the boundary

Owner ruling (2026-07-28): **strict, all the time, everywhere**. Every boundary
this repository owns — authored content inputs, environment values, fetched
data, file reads, hook and CLI inputs — carries a schema and is validated to it
at entry; the host names its founding instance (P14; §This host's bindings).
Official library types count as validation; use Zod
elsewhere. Once validated, the validated type is used throughout the trusted zone
([`strict-validation-at-boundary.md`](../rules/strict-validation-at-boundary.md)).

### The `unknown` boundary exception and the preservation test

Permitted: a function parameter at an incoming external boundary from a
third-party system, where the data genuinely has no known shape yet; and
`z.unknown()` only when the upstream contract genuinely declares no structure.

Forbidden: replacing a concrete type with `unknown` to avoid a type error;
`z.unknown()` where a concrete Zod schema exists or can be derived;
`z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())` as a stand-in for a known object shape;
hand-crafting a Zod schema that approximates a shape the entity schema already
declares (the shadow-schema paragraph above).

**The preservation test.** If the type information exists anywhere in the
pipeline — the entity schema, the inferred types, a library's exported types — it
MUST be preserved. The test runs on the proposed change: can the type be sourced
from the schema or library? If yes, sourcing it is mandatory; using `unknown` in
its place is forbidden.

### The `process.env` boundary exception

`Record<string, string | undefined>` is acceptable at the `process.env` entry
boundary — the key space is genuinely unbounded. Zod validation immediately
narrows it. This is the correct exception to "Record is too generic".

### Zod v4 patterns

- `ZodIssue` is deprecated — derive the type via `ZodError['issues'][number]` (a
  stable structural alternative that avoids coupling to the `$`-prefixed core
  naming convention).
- `.passthrough()` is deprecated — use `.loose()` on existing schemas or
  `z.looseObject()` for new definitions.
- Shared Zod schemas are opt-in contracts: define fields as required in the
  schema; consumers use `.partial()` for optionality. This preserves contract
  semantics: "if you use this capability, you must satisfy these fields."

### Error types

Functions that can fail return `Result<T, E>` from the Practice's `result`
package (P2), not thrown
exceptions ([`use-result-pattern.md`](../rules/use-result-pattern.md)). Error
types are specific, never `Error` or `unknown`; see
[principles.md §Handle All Cases Explicitly](principles.md#code-design-and-architectural-principles).

## Gate layers: what each check proves

Each layer catches a different class of defect; the layers compose, and the
canonical run order lives in the
[gates skill](../skills/change-custody/gates/SKILL-CANONICAL.md).

1. **Formatting** — consistent style, no merge noise.
2. **Type correctness** — compile-time type safety.
3. **Linting** — code patterns, import boundaries, architectural rules. The
   custom rules in the host's ESLint standards plugin (P19) encode architectural
   decisions as enforceable checks.
4. **Static analysis** (knip, dependency-cruiser) — unused code, exports and
   dependencies; circular dependencies; layer violations. Linting enforces _what
   you should do_; static analysis detects _what you forgot to clean up_.
5. **Testing and checks** — the test suite proves product behaviour at every
   level, with no IO; the E2E and smoke checks are validation checks of the
   running system and its shipped form.
6. **Mutation checks** (§Prove the guard bites) — test-suite effectiveness: proves
   tests detect real faults, not merely exercise code paths.
7. **Build** — every derived surface compiles from its one authority.
8. **Specialist review** (sub-agents) — architectural compliance, security,
   documentation.
9. **Accessibility and rendered proof** — WCAG 2.2 AA, both themes, zero
   tolerance, by the instruments the host declares (P25).

The host's commands for each layer are in §This host's bindings.

## Gate integrity: a green check proves its own path, nothing more

A green gate is evidence about the path the gate exercised — never about the path
production runs. Worked instance (2026-07-2x): a Vitest unit test passed on a
runtime fact the real build path could not satisfy, because Vite resolves
workspace packages and a `tsx`-driven build script does not — the green unit test
"proved" a resolution the shipped artefact lacked. When a claim is about a RUNTIME
or BUILD property, the check must run on that runtime or build path (a smoke check
on the built artefact, not a unit test on the source graph). Composes with the
`green-parts-red-composition` pattern: per-path checks compose no better than
per-part ones.

### Right tool: a check uses the property's real machinery (owner ruling 2026-08-09)

A validator's subject dictates its instrument. A check about **dependencies** runs
on a dependency **resolver** — dependency-cruiser, AST-based and already in the
blocking chain (group-matched containment via `$1` back-references,
phantom-dependency `dependencyTypes`, first-class dynamic-`import()` and `require`
analysis) — never on textual pattern-matching of source. Regex import-scanning is
the wrong tool: its silent-pass classes (literal dynamic imports, unrecognised
path idioms, comment-stripping bypasses) are the instrument's shape, not bugs to
patch one spelling at a time. Prefer the instrument that exercises the property's
real path over a textual shadow of it.

The module-system policy those rules enforce (owner ruling 2026-08-09): this
estate is **strictly ESM — zero `require` statements**; the presence of a
`require` IS the finding, never a style note. **Dynamic `import()` is strongly
discouraged**: it errors by default, with any sanctioned use carried as a
recorded, per-instance exemption in the rule configuration — never a silent
allowance. Worked instance, in OCE (2026-08-09): its workspace-config-isolation
containment leg's replacement with dependency-cruiser rules was ruled at the
owner's word.

**An observation is an instrument** (owner, 2026-09-14, verbatim: "sometimes
you don't need an automated check @validation-strategy.md sometimes you need
an observation"). Where the property's real machinery cannot run inside a
test (git's own merge semantics, a filesystem, a running vendor, a spawned
process), because tests never use or create IO
([testing-strategy.md](testing-strategy.md) §Philosophy), the property is
exercised once at cure time by hand and the run is recorded on the pull
request and in the records: the commands, the inputs, what was seen. An
observation is dated, first-hand and reproducible from its record; it is
never narrated as a suite's proof, and a suite is never built to replace it
with IO. Worked instance, in OCE's estate (2026-09-14): its review-cost
gate's sync predicate, proven by unit tests over injected git output plus one
recorded run of the real git on its PR #146, a scratch repository exercising
the admitted and refused merge shapes by hand.

## Prove the guard bites: claim-directed mutation checks

When a change's value IS an assertion (a test instrument, a validator, a guard),
each claim the change makes lands with a mutant that negates exactly that claim,
verified killed in the same commit. The binding statement is
[testing-strategy.md §Prove the guard bites](testing-strategy.md); the
checker-level form (a negative control in an isolated fixture, for a checker
whose failure cannot be planted in the live tree) is the pattern
`prove-the-checker-with-a-negative-control` in the patterns tier (a directive names
a pattern, never links it: doctrine cites doctrine, PDR-105);
this is the method:

1. Pick one mutant per failure mode the change claims to close — negate the claim
   itself (invert the predicate, drop the branch, skip the write), never an
   incidental line. A mutant that leaves a syntax error is killed by the parser,
   not by the claim: replace a removed statement with a no-op (`:` in shell,
   `void 0` in TypeScript) so the mutant fails on the claim itself (2026-09-25).
2. Apply it as a temporary forward file edit from a driver script that holds the
   original text (string-replace with a matched-needle assertion; restore by
   writing the original back — never via `git checkout` / `git restore`).
3. Run the narrowest suite that judges the claim; record the outcome; restore;
   re-run green.
4. Read the direction honestly. At unit level a mutant is killed when a cell
   fails. Against a live surface that is already red from a known defect, the
   direction inverts: the mutant must turn the red cell GREEN — that proves the
   new assertion (not some other break) is what catches the defect. "The cell went
   red" alone is evidence a defect surfaced, not evidence the instrument caught it.
5. The durable record is the commit body: which mutants, judged where, with what
   outcome. Driver scripts are throwaway.

A mutation score, where one is ever measured, is evidence, never a gate (owner
doctrine 2026-08-05); promotion to a gate is a separate owner decision with its
own evidence.

## Validators: the fewest processes, never a change to the code, never a build

The owner's words of 2026-09-29, verbatim: "tests are FORBIDDEN to create real IO and child
processes. I don't want excuses or carve outs, we have these rules for a reason", and
"validation scripts can start real processes, but they are to be kept to a MINIMUM, and they
are FORBIDDEN from altering the code or triggering builds".

- **Tests** use no IO and start no process, with no exception
  ([testing-strategy.md](testing-strategy.md) §Philosophy).
- **A validator** may start real processes, and starts only the fewest its property needs.
- **A validator never alters the code**: no formatter or fixer in its writing mode, no repair,
  no code generator, no install, nothing written into this repository's checkouts, worktrees or
  their `node_modules`. A scratch directory under the system temp root is not the code.
- **A validator never triggers a build**: it reads the artefact a separate step built, and
  when that artefact is absent it fails and names the step.
- What a validator cannot prove inside these bounds is proven once, by an observation made at
  cure time and recorded (§Right tool), never by a suite.
- A check whose purpose is a code-altering mode (a repair, a `--write`, a `--fix`) is neither a
  test nor a validator. Its logic is proven in process against injected fakes; the real tool's
  effect is an observation.
- A file's directory or suffix ("smoke", "e2e") never licenses a process; its class follows what
  it does.

Worked instance (2026-09-28 to 2026-09-29): a repair "smoke" ran source through a loader,
started seven processes a run, ran both repair modes, and linked the repository's
`node_modules` into a scratch repository. Three review findings on its process lifecycle were
each cured with more process handling. One run by hand reinstalled through the link and
emptied a worktree's `node_modules`.

## Validation jurisdiction: we validate our own systems

Every validator names whose system it validates, and external-system content is
never in scope — the testing doctrine's existing "NEVER test external
functionality, that is not under our control"
([testing-strategy.md](testing-strategy.md)), applied to the whole validation
estate. A check whose walk crosses territory another system owns (an external
installer's output, a vendor's artefacts) must be scoped so that territory is
invisible to it, never tolerated through an exemption list: an exemption over
foreign territory is a jurisdiction claim wearing a tolerance, and it converts the
other system's normal output into findings. Class membership derives from the
owned system's own definition — location, recorded derivation, declared
membership — never from name patterns, which are configurable. Worked instance
(2026-08-12): a skills reconciliation sweep adjudicated every entry at the
projection roots, defining an external skills CLI's standard install layout as a
defect tolerated only via a homegrown lock exemption; cured by recognising
Practice projections through their recorded derivation and leaving everything
else untouched.

## Visibility precedes validation

A validator over a shape nobody has ratified promotes the accidental to the
canonical (owner correction, 2026-07-09, on an audit of agent-facing content
that had evolved organically: "a validator at this time might accidentally
lock in shapes that evolved organically and without intention or oversight").
Before proposing any validator, guard or eval gate, ask whether the surface's
shape has been ratified from first principles. If not, the sequence is: make
the shape visible and reviewable (a registry, a report), let the right people
judge it, ratify the intended shape, and only then guard it. The reflex to
guard drift the moment it is found presupposes that the current shape is
intended.

## Eval home

Evaluation **definitions are always version-controlled in-repo** with the
artefact they grade. Skills, prompts and sub-agents carry their evals as in-repo
`evals/evals.json` (agentskills.io convention), run in-repo and reviewed in PRs.
Any external runner is execution only, never the source of truth.

## The real-world loop (non-negotiable closure)

Test / evaluate / assure is an **internal-confidence triad** — every layer grades
against an expectation _we_ authored. It only becomes trustworthy when closed
against a real-world signal of value: how the consumers of the published
surfaces actually behave, with eval corpora **seeded from real usage
distributions** so the loop is structural, not bolted on. Which instrument
captures that signal is the host's (§This host's bindings); where none is named,
no assurance case claims closure.

## What is not eval-shaped

Diffuse, long-horizon, cultural capability (doctrine, planning discipline,
collaboration) does not decompose into `prompt → graded output`. It takes a
different instrument (retrospective, experience corpus), not a forced
`evals/evals.json`. Forcing eval-shape onto it is the mirror category error of
treating evals as tests.

## This host's bindings

The values the shared text above names by parameter, for this host
(jimcresswell.net). The sibling estate's copy of this file carries its own
section here; everything above it is the same text in both.

- **Assurance tier instances**: Critical — a public claim about a real person
  or organisation carried by the entity graph, the CV, the PDF or the JSON-LD
  (tests, strict schema validation of the graph, human review of the rendered
  claim). Standard — page composition, navigation, metadata, media negotiation
  (tests, the Playwright E2E suite, the visual regression harness as rendered
  proof). Light — formatting, scaffolding, Practice tooling.
- **P14, the founding instance of strict validation**: the entity graph's
  validation in `jcdotnet/lib`, over the content JSON under `jcdotnet/content/`.
- **P19, the ESLint standards plugin**: `@engraph/eslint` under `tooling/eslint/`.
- **P25, the gate commands**: formatting `format-check:root` and
  `markdownlint-check:root`; type correctness `type-check`; linting `lint`,
  `lint:shell`, `lint:runtime-only`; static analysis `knip:gate`, `depcruise`;
  testing and checks `test` and `test:e2e` (the site's Playwright suite and
  the agent-tools end-to-end and smoke runner, one turbo task across the
  workspaces); build `build`, deriving every surface from the entity graph;
  accessibility and rendered proof: axe in the E2E suite and
  `visual-regression:harness`.
- **The real-world signal**: no instrument is named yet; it is an owner
  decision, and until it is made no assurance case here claims closure.
- **The TypeScript gotchas reference**:
  [`.agent/reference/typescript-gotchas.md`](../reference/typescript-gotchas.md).
