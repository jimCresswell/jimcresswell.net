# Continuity Practice

Continuity is an engineering property: the next session can recover
orientation quickly and truthfully after interruption, handoff,
compaction, or restart.

This is not a claim about model consciousness or private memory. It is
a practice design problem handled through directives, commands,
plans, operational memory, active memory, and permanent documentation.

## Surface Roles

Each continuity surface has one job. Do not let live state, doctrine,
and historical explanation collapse into one file.

| Surface | Role |
| --- | --- |
| This directive | Strategy, rules, and process for continuity |
| `.agent/memory/operational/repo-continuity.md` | Compact repo-level active state |
| `.agent/memory/operational/threads/<slug>.next-session.md` | Per-thread identity, landing target, and lane state |
| `.agent/memory/active/napkin.md` | Session observations, surprises, and corrections |
| `.agent/memory/active/distilled.md` | Refined cross-session lessons conserved between capture and graduation |
| Permanent docs, ADRs, PDRs, rules | Graduated doctrine and enforcement |

The rule of thumb: if a claim should remain true across many sessions,
it belongs here or in permanent doctrine. If it answers "what is live
right now?", it belongs in operational memory.

**Tracking tiers.** The substrate has three tiers on the tracking axis,
and **only local state is git-ignored**: *memory* (knowledge — tracked),
*repo state* (work-in-progress that is checkout-portable — tracked;
`repo-continuity.md` and `threads/*.next-session.md` live here), and
*local state* (checkout/session-specific — git-ignored; `.agent/state/`
claims and comms). The discriminator: *would this be true on another
checkout?* If yes it is repo state (tracked); if it is true only for this
checkout right now it is local state. This is the existing boundary — ADR-203
keeps the live coordination tier of `.agent/state/collaboration/` (comms,
handoffs, the claims registry, the rendered log) untracked-by-design while its
decision-provenance surfaces (`conversations/`, `escalations/`, `sidebars/`)
stay tracked, and PDR-094 (v4, 2026-07-26) governs the extraction-gated
archive disposition — full extraction first, then the raw source archives
as obligation-free mining substrate, never as a hedge. Full
table: `.agent/memory/README.md` §Tracking Tiers.

## Disposition of Continuity Surfaces

This section is scoped to the **continuity surfaces** —
`repo-continuity.md` and `threads/<slug>.next-session.md` — and to the
journal-shaped records and registers beside them that accumulate finished
history (`director-handoff.md`, `frictions-register.md` and
`review-cost-ledger.md`, where the estate keeps them). Other surface
types (the napkin, distilled, buffers) have their own disposition notes
and lifecycles; nothing here changes them or the fitness apparatus.

The fitness checker **only surfaces a signal** when a surface crosses its
thresholds — it takes no action. The agent who sees the signal decides
what to do, guided by the surface's `overflow_disposition` note. For a
continuity surface, crossing a threshold is a routing signal, not a
trigger to shrink the file; the question is "what is the state of the
work this content describes?". Two dispositions:

1. **The work is live** — it still needs doing. The content **stays in
   place**, verbatim, however large. A truthful record of live work is
   worth more than a tidy file.
2. **The work is finished** — landed, abandoned, or superseded.
   **Graduate, then archive** (owner decision, 2026-09-17): first, every
   entry that would change a reader's behaviour is written into its
   permanent home (ADR, PDR, governance doc, plan, pattern, rule, or — for
   a still-live operational fact — the compact current-state surface), and
   the home is read back to confirm it holds the substance; then the
   finished history moves whole to a dated archive beside the surface
   (`archive/<surface>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`; a second archive of one surface on one
   day takes a letter suffix, `-YYYY-MM-DDb.md`, and an existing archive is
   never overwritten), proven byte-identical to the moved
   range against the committed blob, as the napkin rotation proves its
   archive (where the finished ranges are not contiguous, the archive is a
   snapshot of the whole pre-curation file, proven byte-identical to its
   committed blob, and the live file is then curated); and the live surface
   keeps only the live state and a one-line pointer to the archive (the path
   written inline as code: the link validator's target set excludes archive
   directories, and the commit gate refuses a markdown link into one). Git retains the literal
   record either way; the archive keeps it readable without a checkout of history.

**Archiving happens only after full processing, never as a means to tick a
box** (owner, 2026-09-19, verbatim: "archiving happens ONLY after full
processing, not as a means to tick a box"). The archive is the lifecycle's
last step, taken once every entry in the range has been read and its
behaviour-changing substance is proven in its home. It is never a parking
place for uncurated content, and a surface whose entries are not all
processed stays where it is, whatever its fitness readout says.

A memory surface's lifecycle has four parts, and a surface is curated only
when it has all four: a **role** (what it is for), a **disposition** for
finished content (the two above), a **trigger** (the moment and the skill
step that run the disposition: the `consolidate-docs` skill's continuity
step, beside napkin rotation), and a **proof** that nothing was lost (the
byte-identity check, and the runbook's token and neighbour checks below).
Until 2026-09-17 only the napkin had all four; the continuity surfaces had
a disposition and a runbook that no skill step invoked, so they grew. Every
surface that grows carries fitness frontmatter, and every continuity
surface's `overflow_disposition` note points here; this section is the
canonical statement for that surface type. Splitting, sharding or renaming
a surface for score is still not a disposition: moving content elsewhere is
not the same as conserving its insight.

### Runbook — curating a continuity surface

The repeatable operational procedure for disposition #2 (a runbook per
[PDR-120](../practice-core/decision-records/PDR-120-runbooks-are-a-content-kind-not-a-surface.md),
embedded here in the doctrine it enacts):

1. **Per entry, ask "live or finished?"** — never infer from age or fitness status.
   Every entry is read before anything moves. The reading may be done by the curating
   seat or by a set of readers over pieces of the surface, and the two differ only at
   the join, so the obligation is met when the join checks pass (every cross-reference
   resolves, every id occurs once, a status stated in another entry agrees), not when
   one context has held every line (owner, 2026-09-20; the split method and its checks
   are `consolidate-until-done` step 7). Each reader's claim that bears on a move is
   verified at its source by the seat before that entry moves.
2. **Route by disposition.** Finished and insight-homed → the entry joins the range to
   archive, but *verify the home holds it first* (the `verify-dont-trust` rule; "it's
   all homed" is a convenient claim to check, not trust). Finished and un-homed → route
   the insight to its permanent home, *then* add it to the range. Live → keep,
   compacted (a compact pointer, not the landing narrative). Compact bloated index-table cells to
   the index shape — lane state lives in the thread record, not here.
3. **Verify losslessness mechanically** (after the rewrite, before committing): the
   archive file's blob equals the moved range's bytes (for a whole-file snapshot, the
   pre-curation file's committed blob); every live-pointer token from
   the pre-curation file still appears in the live surface (`grep -F` each); every
   curated passage's statement about a neighbour is re-read against the neighbour (a
   passage saying an "UNCOMMITTED" block had since been committed was the only place
   that fact lived, 2026-09-17; a token grep cannot see it); the
   index-table row count is unchanged; the link-reference count is unchanged;
   `markdownlint` is clean. An *empty dropped-token set is the proof* — the "I kept
   everything" assertion is not (the loss-detector mirrors the `semantic-merge` skill
   §Verify and
   [PDR-119](../practice-core/decision-records/PDR-119-agent-memory-as-an-event-graph-with-renderers.md)).

## Continuity Questions

### Operational continuity

Can the next session answer:

- which thread is active?
- which plan is authoritative?
- what must not be violated?
- what is the next safe step?

### Epistemic continuity

Can the next session recover recent corrections, uncertainty, and
changed understanding rather than just a task list?

### Institutional continuity

Can learning survive beyond the current session and become shared
repo practice?

## Process Loops

Two loops exist, and they are not the same.

### Lightweight Continuity Loop

Every session closes with `wrap` (owner ruling 2026-07-28), which runs
`session-handoff` as its continuity component.

The component's responsibilities are deliberately narrow:

- record landed or unlanded outcome against the landing target;
- refresh compact active state in `repo-continuity.md`;
- update touched thread records;
- capture surprises and corrections in the napkin;
- run the consolidation gate.

It does not imply full review, commit, push, or deep convergence.

### Deep Consolidation Loop

Use `consolidate-docs` only when deep convergence is due.

Triggers include:

- plan or milestone closure;
- settled doctrine or design rationale stranded in ephemeral artefacts;
- practice exchange that needs processing;
- napkin, distilled, pattern, or fitness pressure that requires action;
- repeated surprises suggesting a rule, pattern, ADR, or PDR;
- documentation drift or stale cross-references that need graduation.

Deep consolidation owns graduation, pattern extraction, napkin
rotation, fitness management, and practice exchange.

## Continuity Contract

The live continuity contract belongs in
`.agent/memory/operational/repo-continuity.md`.

`session-handoff` refreshes it using these fields:

- `Active threads`;
- `Branch-primary lane state`;
- `Current session focus`, only when distinct from the branch-primary lane;
- `Repo-wide invariants / non-goals`;
- `Next safe step`;
- `Deep consolidation status`.

Keep that file compact and operational. Active plans remain
authoritative for scope, sequencing, acceptance criteria, and
validation. Thread records carry per-thread identity and lane state.

Do not create a generic "standing decisions" bucket. Standing
decisions live in their proper homes: ADRs, PDRs, directives, rules,
plans, or thread records.

Lane state folds into `threads/<slug>.next-session.md` per PDR-027.

## Continuation Records

Permanent skills and directives carry routing behaviour. Thread records
and handoff records carry volatile facts: branch, controlling
plan, next safe step, active team expectation, validation state, and commit
evidence.

Write continuation records as current-state pointers, not as skill bodies.
After a commit window lands, replace phrases such as "ready to land" with the
actual commit evidence or an explicit unlanded state. A stale "ready to land"
phrase after the work has committed is a continuity defect because the next
session cannot tell whether it should stage work, verify a commit, or move on.

**Supersession refreshes the whole auto-surfaced chain.** A pass that
supersedes a decision, plan state, or next step MUST update the first
surfaces a fresh session reads — the thread-record top and the
`repo-continuity.md` next-safe-step entry — not only the plan body or the
deep artefact. A superseded fact that survives on an auto-surfaced
continuity surface outranks the correction in practice, because the next
session reads the continuity chain first. (Owner-approved fold,
2026-06-11 walk.)

## GO

`GO` is a complementary execution cadence, not a handoff surface.

Use it after `start-right-quick` when:

- the session is likely to span more than one focused execution block;
- multiple active plan surfaces are in play;
- the risk of drift is rising and the todo list needs re-grounding.

`GO` starts from the session-start workflow, `repo-continuity.md`,
the relevant thread record, and the active plan set. Close every
session with `wrap` (which runs `session-handoff`). Use
`consolidate-docs` only when the trigger checklist says deep
convergence is due.

## Surprise Pipeline

Surprise is useful when it changes behaviour.

The pipeline is:

`capture -> distil -> graduate -> enforce`

- **Capture** surprises and corrections in the napkin as they happen.
- **Distil** recurring or high-signal observations into `distilled.md`
  or a pattern candidate.
- **Graduate** stable understanding into an ADR, PDR, governance doc,
  README, TSDoc, or rule.
- **Enforce** recurring failure modes through a command boundary,
  pattern, rule, quality gate, or amended decision record.

Use the napkin surprise shape: expected, actual, why the expectation
failed, and behaviour change.

## Non-Goals

- No new continuity reviewer or specialist by default.
- No giant opaque memory layer.
- No vector-memory substitute for disciplined handoff.
- No default full consolidation at every session end.
- No operational history in this directive; history belongs in
  archives, git, plans, or active-state records while still live.
