# Security Operations

Operational security practices for this repository. These rules apply to all contributors — human
and AI.

## Guiding principle

If content would be useful to a social engineer, it does not belong in version control. This applies
to commit messages, plan files, code comments, and any other tracked content.

Four engineering principles sit under it:

- **Least privilege** — every credential, token and integration carries the narrowest access that
  does the job.
- **Defence in depth** — no single control is sufficient alone; each layer catches what the others
  miss.
- **Fail secure** — an error path lands on the safe default, never on an open one.
- **No trust assumptions** — every external input is validated before use.

## Git identity

Use `git@jimcresswell.net` as the author email for commits made in a local checkout. All commits
must carry a GitHub-verifiable cryptographic signature; GPG and SSH signatures are both accepted.
GitHub-generated merge or squash commits may use GitHub's platform identity and GPG signature.

```bash
git config user.email "git@jimcresswell.net"
git config commit.gpgsign true
```

For SSH signing, also configure the public key registered with GitHub as a signing key:

```bash
git config gpg.format ssh
git config user.signingkey "$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
```

## Credentials and API keys

- **Environment variables only.** Credentials live in environment variables or the untracked `.env`
  and `.env.local` files — never in code, never in version control. Tracked example files carry
  placeholders only ([SECURITY.md §Credentials Policy](../../SECURITY.md)).
- **Validated on startup.** Keys are validated with Zod schemas before use, so a missing or
  malformed credential fails at boot rather than mid-request.
- **Never logged.** A key never reaches a log line, even at debug level.
- **Rotation is an environment change.** Rotate a key by updating the environment variable; no
  application code changes, and the process restarts to pick up the new value.

### Agent tool choice when reading credential-bearing files

For any file that may hold credentials (`~/.claude.json`, `.env*`, auth configs, agent
tool-server settings, service-account files), agents default to the `Read` tool rather than Bash
`grep`, `cat` or `head`. The repo's secrets-scan `PreToolUse` hook covers `Read` only; the Bash
hook is a command-pattern blocker, not a content scanner — so a Bash read drives through the
gap between the two defences (worked instance 2026-04-24: a
`grep -i sonar ~/.claude.json | head` surfaced a real-looking token into the transcript). When
Bash is genuinely required (line counts, directory walks), structure the command so
value-bearing lines never reach stdout — `grep -l` / `grep -c`, or exclude token-like lines
before printing. The same discipline applies to sub-agent briefs: never ask a sub-agent to
"grep the config" when it can `Read` it under the scanner.

## Secret scanning

The repo is scanned with `gitleaks`. The `secrets:scan` stage is part of `pnpm check` (the pre-push
gate) and CI runs it on every push and pull request; both walk every branch and tag. It catches
accidental credentials but does not detect PII or psychological content — the rules in
[privacy.md](privacy.md) cover those categories.

Broad allowlisting is not permitted. If a token-like placeholder must remain in tracked docs, use a
line-specific allowlist comment:

```text
EXAMPLE_API_KEY=example_token_value # gitleaks:allow
```

Path-level allowlists exist only for third-party reference material (`.agent/reference/**`) and test
files, as declared in `.gitleaks.toml`.

Escalation path:

- `pnpm secrets:scan` for routine local commit/branch checks
- `pnpm secrets:scan:all` for bootstrap and audit scans across branches and tags
- `pnpm secrets:scan:all-refs` for repository forensics across all refs

## Application security

- **Validate every external input at the boundary** with strict Zod schemas: request parameters
  before processing, environment variables on startup, external API responses before use.
- **Sanitise error output.** Internal details never reach a user: stack traces only in development,
  upstream errors mapped to generic user-facing messages, sensitive data scrubbed from logs.
  Validation errors name the field without internal detail; not-found responses reveal no structure;
  permission errors give no hint of which permission is missing; rate-limit responses say a limit
  exists without exposing its value; internal errors return a generic message and log the detail
  internally only.
- **No dynamic code execution** — no `eval`, no `new Function`.
- **Type safety is a security control** — no `any`, no `as` assertions, runtime validation at
  boundaries ([principles.md §Compiler Time Types and Runtime Validation](principles.md)).

## Dependencies and lockfile

- **Minimal dependencies**, kept current; the dependency-currency skill runs the full pass.
- **Exact versions** via `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- **Vulnerability governance.** An audit finding is cured by a version bump or, where no fixed
  release exists, by an annotated override floor in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  ([build-system.md](../../docs/engineering/build-system.md)). Overrides are temporary controls
  that must name the vulnerable dependency, why the override is safe, and the condition for
  removal — and they must survive a rebuild
  ([lockfile-rebuild-survivability](../rules/lockfile-rebuild-survivability.md)).
- **Never claim a dependency-audit CI gate that the checked workflow does not run.**

## PII audit checklist

Before making this repository public (or changing visibility), audit for:

- [ ] Personal email addresses in tracked files and git history
- [ ] Psychological profile content (see [privacy.md](privacy.md) for categories)
- [ ] Physical location specifics beyond what is intentionally public
- [ ] Political specifics (year, party, ward, outcome)
- [ ] Third-party names without consent
- [ ] Private editorial sources, drafts or analysis outside the ignored private repository

## Content in plan files

Plan files in `.agent/plans/` are version-controlled and will be visible if the repo is public. They
should be written as if they will be read by anyone.

- Store editorial constraints and decisions in plan files.
- Store private sources, drafts, evidence and analysis in the ignored private editorial repository,
  not in plan files.
- Point only to its local routing README. Never publish the private remote, commit identifiers or
  source-level details in a public plan.

## History-rewrite boundary

A public-history rewrite is an exceptional recovery operation, not ordinary cleanup. Before any
rewrite or force push, preserve and verify the complete live state: Git refs and object database,
index, tracked and untracked changes, ignored sources, relevant pull-request state, and any
out-of-repo material needed for recovery. Use a private remote and a fresh-clone check so custody is
not single-disk.

Build and test the replacement in an isolated clone. Push only with an exact `--force-with-lease`
against the observed old ref, then verify a fresh public clone, the pull request and all regenerated
checks. Rewriting a branch reduces ordinary reachability; it does not prove that hosting-provider
caches or infrastructure no longer retain old objects. See
[private-editorial-workspace.md](../reference/private-editorial-workspace.md).

## Incident response

Report security issues by following [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) at the repository root:
GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository, or the owner's published contact.
Never report a security issue via a public GitHub issue. Security patches ship as soon as possible
and are disclosed through GitHub security advisories.

## Security checklist before committing

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] All external inputs validated with Zod
- [ ] Error messages do not leak internal details
- [ ] PII scrubbed from every output ([privacy.md](privacy.md))
- [ ] No `any` or type assertions
- [ ] Security implications documented in the change
- [ ] Tests cover the security edge cases: PII scrubbing, error-message leakage, input validation
      and injection attempts

## Review cadence

Audit the repository against the PII checklist above before any change in public visibility. The
audit should cover both the working tree and the full git history.
