# Test Immediate-Fails Checklist

Any single item below is an **immediate fail** — the test is rejected
without further analysis. This is the fast gate test-expert applies
first; tests that pass it then receive the full checklist.

Rooted in `.agent/directives/testing-strategy.md` (the dependency-injection
pattern is in `docs/engineering/testing-patterns.md` §In-Process Tests with
Dependency Injection).
Violations indicate product-code design problems, not test-authorship
problems — the fix is usually at the product-code level (expose a
seam, extract a pure function, inject a dependency).

## Boundary Immediate Fails

1. **Test imports product code that is not directly under test.**
   Tests must import only the unit they are testing. Incidental
   production factories (`createHttpObservabilityOrThrow`,
   `loadRuntimeConfig`, `initialiseTelemetry`, app bootstrappers) that
   the test is not proving must be replaced with a fake injected via
   DI. Rationale: imports define the test boundary; a test that
   imports factory X is coupled to X's behaviour and breaks on
   unrelated refactors of X.
2. **Test imports a complex test helper it does not own.** If the
   helper exists to make the test runnable (not to prove the unit),
   the helper itself has become incidental infrastructure. Fix the
   product code or inline a simple fake.
3. **Test uses a real production object where a fake would suffice.**
   E.g. real logger, real observability, real database adapter, real
   HTTP client. If the test does not assert on that object's
   behaviour, it must not receive a real instance.

## Side-Effect Immediate Fails

4. **Any test triggers any IO.** IO is a filesystem read or write, a
   network call, a socket (loopback included), a child process, a
   clock read (`Date.now()`, `new Date()`, `performance.now()`), a
   timer that interacts with the runtime, or an SDK init call with
   side effects, in the test or in any helper it imports. This is
   the absolute invariant of `testing-strategy.md` §Philosophy
   (owner, 2026-09-14 and 2026-09-15). A filesystem read is IO
   whatever the provenance of the bytes: committed fixtures enter a
   test as imported modules or as literal values. A fixture-reading
   `test-helpers/` module (the lineage's two worked instances were a
   conformance-suite fixture loader and a codegen schema-cache reader)
   is a defect under this item; existing code is evidence of the
   estate and carries no approval
   ([PDR-091](../practice-core/decision-records/PDR-091-precedence-is-not-approval.md)).
5. **Any test (unit or integration) touches `process.env`.** Reading OR writing `process.env` is prohibited.
   Pass literal inputs; do not inherit from shell state.
6. **Any test touches `process.cwd()`.** A test has no file path to
   anchor (item 4); a path the unit needs is passed in as a literal.
7. **Any test reads from `.env` / `.env.local` / any
   runtime environment file.** Tests construct config literals
   directly; they do not route through loaders that read disk.
8. **Any test spawns a child process, fork, or test-authored
   worker.** Covered by `testing-strategy.md` §Rules, "No process spawning
   in tests". A proof that needs a real child process (a child's stdio
   topology, its exit and signal fidelity) is an observation made
   once and recorded, or a validator's self-proof outside the test
   suites. The directive is the authority; this item points at it.
9. **Any test makes a real network or socket call.** Driving a
   separately running system is an E2E check, a validation surface.
   Code imported into the test process is proven at the handler
   seam, called directly: a harness's loopback listener is a socket.
   Network reach lives in validation checks run by CI-gated tasks, the
   deploy pipeline and operator context; never in a test.

## Mock/Stub Immediate Fails

10. **Test uses `vi.stubGlobal`, `vi.mock`, `vi.doMock`.** Global
    state manipulation; prohibited outright. Use DI.
11. **Unit test contains any mock.** Unit tests are pure — no mocks,
    fakes, or stubs of any kind. Parameters in, result out.
12. **Integration test contains a mock with logic.** Integration
    mocks are *simple* fakes — constant returns, or a record of what
    the product sent out through the port, read as output; which calls
    were made, how often or in what order is never asserted. No
    branching, no state machines, no string interpolation of inputs.
    Complexity signals product-code needs refactoring for
    testability.
13. **Test passes anything other than a fake or constant into the
    unit under test (unit test).** If the unit needs a real object
    to run, the unit is not isolated.

## Structural Immediate Fails

14. **Test authors any function with non-trivial complexity.**
    Helpers in tests must be trivial: build a literal, wrap a call.
    Conditional logic, loops with side effects, or multi-step state
    setup in a test function = test code testing itself.
15. **Test contains skipped or pending cases** (`it.skip`,
    `describe.skip`, `test.todo`, `it.todo`, `xit`, `xdescribe`, or
    any skip/pending mechanism). Fix or delete. See
    `.agent/directives/testing-strategy.md` §Rules.
16. **Test contains conditional execution** of any kind:
    `it.skipIf`, `describe.skipIf`, `it.runIf`, `describe.runIf`,
    conditional `it`/`describe` registration, runtime branching
    inside the test body, conditional assertions
    (`if (env === 'X') expect(...)`), or fixtures whose shape
    varies with ambient state. Conditional tests are an
    architectural-failure signal — the fix lives in product code,
    not in the test. See `no-conditional-tests.md`.
17. **Test does not use DI where DI is possible.** If the unit
    supports a dependency parameter, the test must use it. Do not
    reach past the seam to a module-level singleton.
18. **Test asserts on spies against private/internal methods.**
    Couples the test to implementation; breaks on refactor. Assert
    on return values or public behaviour.
19. **Test proves something about the test scaffolding, not the
    product code.** E.g. asserts that a mock returned the value it
    was configured to return; asserts on types only; tautologies
    (comparing two names at the same value).

## Pipeline Immediate Fails

20. **Test category does not match its file name.** A
    `*.unit.test.ts` that exercises several units working together is an
    integration test under the wrong name: rename it. Per
    `testing-strategy.md`, naming IS the category. A test that touches
    IO is item 4's defect under any name; its cure is an injected seam
    or a move to validation.
21. **Test is named `*.integration.test.ts` but opens a socket, hits
    the network, or spawns processes.** Classify by the boundary,
    then cure: a genuine separately-running-system exchange is an
    E2E or smoke check outside the test suites; outbound IO from
    imported code is a missing DI seam to fix.
22. **Test depends on test-execution order to pass.** Shared mutable
    state between tests is a correctness hazard. Each test must be
    self-contained.

## When to Apply

- As the **first pass** on any test-expert invocation.
- Before any deeper analysis of test value or TDD compliance.
- Findings here block approval; all 22 items must be clean before
  the test suite is considered compliant.

## Fix Direction

Most of these fails point at **product code problems**, not test
problems:

- "Test imports production factory X" → product code lacks a DI seam;
  refactor to accept X as a parameter.
- "A test touches IO" → inject the seam or extract a pure core; what
  needs real IO moves to validation.
- "Integration test has complex mock" → the dependency surface is too
  wide; split the responsibility in product code.

The test-expert flags the symptom. The fix is usually upstream.
