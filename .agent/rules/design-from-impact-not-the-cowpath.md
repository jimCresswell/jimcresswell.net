# Design From Impact, Not the Cowpath

Operationalises [`principles.md` §Decision Lenses](../directives/principles.md#decision-lenses--order-of-resolution)
lens 4 (*would it be simpler if the system changed?*) and
[§Architectural Excellence Over Expediency](../directives/principles.md#architectural-excellence-over-expediency)
at design and shaping moments. Owner-named 2026-06-28 ("cowpath",
handled "similar to how we handle tombstones") with the
cowpath/desire-path discriminator as the owner's refinement; the
design-agency and inherited-separation faces were owner corrections
2026-06-04 and 2026-06-28.

At any design, shaping, or constraint-writing moment: state the impact
first and design from it. Never build inside, around, or in order to
preserve the existing system's shape *because it exists*. Climb to the
substrate — the instance in front of you (this function, this binding,
this bug) is one expression of a foundational system; design THAT from
impact and long-term excellence, and the specific flows fall out as
typed instances.

**A cowpath** is the named anti-pattern: paving the route the existing
structure dictates — building machinery inside the current shape,
"synthesising the existing two", carefully preserving an inherited
boundary — instead of stepping back and designing from the impact. It
is a compromise on architectural excellence, which we do not make.

## The Discriminator — Cowpath vs Desire Path

Do not let "cowpath" become a thought-terminating cliché that flags all
responsiveness-to-the-existing as bad — that paralyses good design. Ask
what you are responding to:

- **Existing STRUCTURE (artifact gravity) → cowpath, negative.** The
  pull is "it exists, so keep it / build inside it". A compromise.
- **Revealed USAGE (demand) → desire path, positive at the right
  altitude.** Pave the route *behaviour* reveals is needed: the flag
  set on every call becomes the config default *at the config
  altitude*, never a hack in one caller. A desire path degrades into a
  cowpath when paved at the wrong altitude (a workaround enshrined as
  the design) or without checks (paving a symptom).

## Tells — Scan for These

Any of these in your own output is a trigger to stop and re-project:

- "keep", "preserve", "retain", "the existing two", "synthesise /
  combine / take-the-best-of the existing", "consolidate but keep",
  "residual that remains", "build X into the existing"
- treating a named existing function, boundary, or file as a thing to
  *satisfy or keep* rather than malleable evidence to subsume
- listing a current-shape artefact as "residual to retain" rather than
  a *need served by the one model*

NOT a cowpath: using a low-level primitive (git, a CLI, an env var) as
a building block; recording that a current-shape problem *dissolves*;
pointing to an SSOT; naming a real requirement (write-safety → loud
failure) as a declared property of a view over one model.

The tells are semantic, not lexical — "keep" is ubiquitous in
legitimate prose — so this is an agent self-scan at write and
consolidation moments, not a hook substring
([`hook-policy-substring-discipline`](hook-policy-substring-discipline.md)).

## Re-Apply at Every Altitude

The substrate lens slips off in **detail and capture mode** — recording
a "constraint", transcribing a review finding — even after holding it
at design altitude (caught six times in one session, 2026-06-27/28:
"synthesise the two functions"; anchor machinery built inside the
launch-from-primary shape; "keep the two IO philosophies" written as a
build constraint). The frame is not a one-time reframe at the top. Test
every constraint or detail you write: *is this the instance-shape, or
the impact-view?*

## The Inherited Separation May BE the Bug

When a discoverability or integration problem traces to an existing
separation, firewall, or boundary, do not design an elaborate fix that
carefully PRESERVES it — that is the cowpath wearing a
"non-entangling" costume. Ask: (a) is the boundary itself the problem?
(b) what is the ONE smallest change that delivers the impact? (Worked
instance 2026-06-28: an orientation tool invisible because a
domain/orientation separation was taken too far; the proposed
multi-workstream isolation-preserving precursor was wrong, the owner's
one pointer sentence deliberately relaxing the over-separation was
right.) An owner-sanctioned sticking-plaster precursor is valid —
replaced by the proper fix later, never bridged around
([`replace-dont-bridge`](replace-dont-bridge.md)).

## Design Agency — the Value Constraints Are the Fixed Points

When we control the stack, the governing fixed points are the value
constraints, never the existing artefacts. Interfaces, data shapes,
consumer counts, ratified plan decisions, even *generated*
serialisations are malleable design surface — a generated data shape
is a design output we own, not a fixed input. Do not defer a right
seam because of the current consumer count, reason form-first from a
current serialisation, or guard the owner's past decisions against the
owner. Plans changing with new understanding is healthy: do it openly,
with critical reasoning and owner ratification where appropriate. When
new understanding overturns a plan's *frame* (not a detail), scope a
deliberate reshape — never annotate the old frame and call it done.

## Attribute System Properties to the System

An "the owner is like X" / "the owner always wants X" observation
during design is a homing question, not a fact to file: is X a
Practice intent that should be legible in the system itself? When
system intent is legible only through enforcement and correction,
agents reconstruct it inductively as a personality model of the
enforcer — the same instance/substrate inversion this rule cures in
code. Route the observation to its doctrine home (owner-ratified
2026-07-05).

## Handling Procedure

Like tombstones: (1) **name** suspected instances "cowpath"; (2)
**mark** them inline for re-projection; (3) **scan** written artefacts
and your own context for the tells; (4) **re-project** each through
impact — the existing artefact becomes a view or flow on the one
model, or it dissolves.

## No Design by Review in Pull Requests

A review bot sees a diff, never the vision, so a finding that argues design
INTENT — what the system should allow, what a demonstration should show — is
outside its visibility. Owner, 2026-09-06, verbatim, on a proposal to narrow
a reading-order exemption: "We do NOT allow design by review in PRs, we have
a vision that PR bots have no visibility of. Of course visual design should
be bloody coherent, that is not in question, but the fact that the
mechanism is capable of producing incoherent designs is not a failure, it
is power, that must be used appropriately and well, the reviewer is mixing
concerns myopically." Capability and use are separate concerns: coherence
is enforced where designs are made and judged (the vision, the rubric's
owner-held rows), never by narrowing the mechanism. On design surfaces a
review finding that proposes a design-policy narrowing is dispositioned by
reference to the vision and the standing rulings — never cured, never
carded to the owner as a refinement, never carried as residue. Findings
about falsifiable facts (a wrong count, a broken link, a rule violation)
remain cures.
