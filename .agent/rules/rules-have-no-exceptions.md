# Rules Have No Exceptions

Operationalises [`principles.md` §Strict and Complete](../directives/principles.md#strict-and-complete).

A rule states what to do, and it holds in every case it governs. The point of
a rule is that one statement is strong enough that nothing has to escape it.

When a case appears that the rule seems not to fit, read it as evidence about
the rule. Improve the rule until its single statement covers the case
correctly — sharpen the principle, state its domain more precisely, or
re-express it so the case falls inside it. The repaired rule is whole again,
and every later reader inherits the fix.

An exception does the reverse. It freezes the misfit into the rule and states
the rule by where it stops holding, so a rule with an exception has stopped
being improved. It also carries the shape
[`no-tombstones-for-removed-ideas`](no-tombstones-for-removed-ideas.md) warns
against — a live instruction defined by what it is not. An exception is a
tombstone for the case the author could not yet fit.

## When a case seems not to fit

1. Read the misfit as evidence the rule is incomplete.
2. Make the smallest change to the rule's statement or its stated domain that
   makes the case fall inside it correctly.
3. If two real cases demand genuinely opposite behaviour, the rule is
   conflating two principles — split it into two rules, each whole on its own.
4. A case you cannot yet resolve is surfaced for an owner doctrine decision,
   never parked inside the rule as a carve-out.
5. An exception claimed on the owner's behalf needs the owner's ruling
   creating it. Owner, 2026-07-25, when a scope ruling about one operation
   had been silently generalised into a standing "remote-only surfaces"
   exemption: "the tripwire is the word exception, unless you can find
   evidence of me saying 'this is a supported exception' then odds are
   you, or a prior agent, made something up." Carry owner rulings at
   exactly the altitude given — no invented exceptions below, no invented
   mechanisms above. And the parity a ruling asks for is parity of
   CAPABILITY and impact, never of mechanism (same day: "we need
   equivalence of impact, not mechanism … step back and focus on value
   delivery, not over literal interpretation of my words"): a capability
   visible on a remote surface must be demonstrable and buildable from the
   repository, while a missing generator is not a debt to recover if the
   capability arrives by a better route.

An act's own check passing is not the same question as which standing ruling
governs the act. A clean tree, a sound verdict and a green gate each answered
"is this act correct?" while a standing ruling forbade the act itself — a
lead removing a peer's local branch, a conscience-check seat stepping from
judging into doing, a build stricter than the ask (three in one day,
2026-09-03). Beside every correctness check, ask "which standing ruling
governs this act?" before acting; the rule that owns the act class carries
the answer, and this rule is why that answer has no exception.

## Apply the whole rule — the escalation clause is part of it

A rule that prohibits a default path almost always names the exception path,
and that path is as binding as the prohibition. Citing the prohibition clause
while skipping the rule's own escalation or surfacing clause is the same
pathology as inventing a gate: inaction dressed as compliance. The worked
instance (2026-07-15): a Director told the owner a boundary-locked seat
"cannot do any work without word from you there, which the protocol forbids
me requesting", citing the routing rule's prohibition while its next clause
said a refusal that blocks every capable session is a matrix survivor and
DOES surface. Owner, verbatim: "the rule always fucking applies and I am
absolutely sick of the double think." Before declaring anything unfixable or
forbidden, re-read the governing rule for its escalation clause; exhaust the
team-side cures it names (including re-checking what a constrained seat's
session HAS demonstrably allowed and assigning work inside that surface);
then surface true survivors immediately as verdicts with a recommendation. A
team member doing no work is a defect to fix or escalate, never a state to
narrate as acceptable.

## A documented bypass is a carve-out, even when the actor is legitimately outside the rule's audience

When a real actor legitimately needs different treatment than the rule
prescribes (release automation writing to `main`; a service account; a
scheduled job), the fix is **scoping the rule's audience explicitly**
("release automation is outside this rule's audience and handles its own
writes"), never **documenting the bypass mechanism** for that actor inside
agent-facing doctrine. A documented mechanism is itself a carve-out: an
exception agents know about is an exception they will eventually argue
themselves into using, and each round of review pressure to "explain how X
still works" tends to add more mechanism detail, compounding the leak.
Audience-scoping states *who the rule does not govern* in one line, with zero
mechanics; it does not teach agents how the excluded actor operates.

Worked instance (2026-07-08, PR #332 arc):
[`never-commit-to-main`](never-commit-to-main.md) initially grew increasingly
detailed documentation of how release automation legitimately writes to
`main` (reviewers pushed for even more mechanism detail, and it was added —
precedent compounding via review pressure). The cure was deleting the
mechanism prose and adding one audience-scope sentence instead: "Release
automation is outside this rule's audience and handles its own writes; its
mechanics are not agent-facing knowledge." Bot reviewers' "won't this block
X?" questions get answered in the PR thread (a record), never folded into
standing doctrine (a teaching surface).

## Why this is strict

Exceptions accrete. Each one is a small licence to stop thinking, and the next
author reads the carve-out as permission to add their own. A rule that holds
everywhere stays sharp and stays trusted; a rule riddled with exceptions
becomes advisory, and an advisory rule is no rule. Fixing the statement is more
work once; an exception is less work paid for forever.
