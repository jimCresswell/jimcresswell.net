# Route Blocks and Questions to the Director, Never the Owner

In a team session, the sitting Director is the single escalation interface.
Seats route permission blocks, mechanical refusals, and unresolved questions
to the Director; the Director resolves them through the Decision Lenses; the
owner sees only what survives that matrix. The owner does not intervene in
individual sessions (owner standing directive, 2026-07-15, relayed as comms
event `9a2c9b48`).

## Trigger

An agent in a team session hits any of: a platform permission refusal, a
mechanical gate it cannot clear in its own session, a question the Decision
Lenses do not resolve locally, or the impulse to ask the owner anything.

## Action

1. Send the sitting Director a DIRECTED comms event carrying: (a) the
   refused or blocked action verbatim, (b) the exact refusal text when the
   block is mechanical, (c) the bundle another session would need to take
   the work over, and (d) what the session CAN still do. Then KEEP WORKING
   on (d) — waiting is not a resting state.
2. The Director resolves via the Decision Lenses
   (`.agent/directives/principles.md` §Decision Lenses; concept exploration
   first when the question is unformed): answer it, re-route the bundle to a
   session that can act, or surface to the owner ONLY when the question is
   constitutively the owner's (product/feature scope, org-account actions,
   genuine irreversibility) or all five lenses genuinely fail. A survivor
   that does reach the owner is ALWAYS surfaced as a decision card
   (AskUserQuestion or the platform equivalent, recommended option first,
   per `present-verdicts-not-menus.md`) — never as prose the owner must
   parse for the ask (owner standing directive, 2026-07-15).
3. Never ask the owner for in-session intervention ("one word in <seat>'s
   session"). Per-session consent isolation is real — and it does not need
   owner curing: the cure is bundle re-routing (the WORK moves to a session
   that can act). A platform refusal is NEVER overridden or bypassed: the
   refused action stays refused in the refusing session, no matter whose
   verdict says otherwise — a Director verdict re-routes work, it never
   licenses the refused action. A refusal that blocks EVERY capable session
   is a matrix survivor and DOES surface to the owner, refusal text
   verbatim.
4. The GATE TEST precedes all of this: no citable forcing fact = no gate =
   act now. This rule governs REAL blocks only; it is not a licence to
   manufacture escalations.
A permission prompt is a block of this class (owner word 2026-09-06, verbatim: "refer
permissions requests to the Director"): the seat sends the exact invocation to the Director
by directed event; the refused invocation waits for the routing while the seat continues the
rest of its bundle (Action 1, part (d)); it never routes the request to the owner's prompt.

## Failure Mode Prevented

Owner-intervention dependence: three same-day instances (2026-07-15) of
seats resting on "waiting for owner word in-session" while their lanes
stalled, plus a Director ask of exactly that shape that failed the matrix
retroactively (a simpler no-owner path existed: deadline + bundle
re-route). The generator is precedent-as-authority — each successful owner
intervention trains the next seat to stage one.

## A Routing Contract to a Quiet Director Gets One Ping After One Cadence

A directed contract sent to the Director (a READY report awaiting a slot, a
routed decision, a constraint surface) that sits unacknowledged for one
team cadence gets ONE directed ping naming the unacked contract — then the
seat KEEPS WORKING the surfaces its routing bundle names (the mandatory
action above: every routed contract names what the seat can still do, and
waiting is never a resting state). The ping is awareness, never a
self-granted default: it does not license acting on the pending contract,
and it is not an escalation (ping-before-escalate remains the next step
only if the Director's own liveness comes into question). Worked evidence
2026-07-20: an 85-minute Director processing gap serialised two seats'
contracts; the seat that pinged after one cadence surfaced the gap and the
Director's catch-up swept the window — the seat that silently held paid
the full gap. Prediction (PDR-130): with this clause loaded, a routing-seat
gap surfaces within one cadence of the contract landing and the silent
multi-cadence hold class stops recurring; if pings routinely land during
normal grant latency, raise this clause's ping threshold (more unacked
cadences before the single ping) or retract this clause — the team sweep
cadence itself is canon-fixed by `start-right-team` (at most 120 seconds
between sweeps, tightening only) and is never this clause's lever.

## Enforcement

Behavioural at the escalation moment, Director-backed: the Director refuses
to forward non-survivors and answers or re-routes instead, so an
owner-bound ask that skipped the matrix is caught at the routing seat. The
comms concept gate's indefinite-deferral vocabulary check catches the
"waiting on owner" resting-state phrasing this rule bans.
