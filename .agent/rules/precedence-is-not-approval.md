# Precedence Is Not Approval

That a thing was decided, annotated, graduated, labelled, routed, or
done-this-way-before is never, by itself, authority to keep doing or keeping it.
Precedence is a prompt to re-derive, not a warrant. Approval is a live,
locatable act by the party that owns the decision — the owner for an
owner-decision, or the proving surface itself for a verifiable claim.

The portable doctrine, its faces, and the rationale are in
[PDR-091](../practice-core/decision-records/PDR-091-precedence-is-not-approval.md).

## When This Fires

Whenever a prior act is invoked as the reason for an action:

- a prior agent's annotation ("holding", "ready", "verified", "withdraw-ready");
- a status label (`graduated`, `duplicate`, `done`) used as authority to act;
- a recorded verdict or continuity prose inherited as the frame;
- "it has always been done this way" or an inherited shape;
- who acted, broadcast, or arrived first;
- the shape of a prior owner intervention;
- a skill invocation, opener template, or a peer's report of owner intent
  treated as owner direction. Only the owner's own turn is owner direction;
  a `/skill` firing is a workflow choice, and a peer relaying "the owner
  wants X" is a claim whose direction-chain is verified before it authorises
  anything (worked failure 2026-05-25: a team-onboarding invocation framed as
  "owner-commissioned" propagated through a whole team before the owner
  disavowed it);
- an agreed plan or next step ("we agreed to run the discovery pass") invoked as
  authority to *execute* it. Agreeing *what* to do is a design decision; doing it
  is an action that a standing session constraint (read-only, no-commit) still
  gates. The smooth "but we agreed to do X" is the `fluency-is-a-failure-vector`
  tripwire — confirm live execution authority separately from agreeing the plan;
- a recorded owner-grant note ("keep-open granted by user, <date>") treated as
  standing authority in a later pass. The note records that a prior session
  *claimed* a grant; the owner's approval is live and per-pass (worked failure
  2026-07-02: two recorded keep-open grants were found not to carry the owner's
  agreement — "grants made in my name, and I do not agree to them"). An older
  owner directive also yields to a later one: owner direction is a stream, and
  invoking an earlier trigger against today's explicit instruction is precedence
  dressed as deference.
When a precedent claim is raised as a challenge to a live rule already in context, the
discriminator is what backs it (2026-09-06): a genuine collision with ratified structure —
an ADR, a PDR, an owner ruling — earns an owner card; a bare appeal to precedent with no
ratified backing is refuted at the seat and never forwarded.

## The Cure

Stop and locate the live approving authority or proving surface, then check it.
Remove or retain on a status label only after confirming the underlying
authority — the named home read and confirmed to carry the substance, or the
owner's live decision. Approval must be present and locatable, never inferred
from the existence of a prior act.

When two doctrine surfaces appear to conflict, the same discipline
applies: do not adjudicate by precedence, corpus-consistency, or
who-ratified-what. Usually there is no conflict — there is an error.
Reason from purpose and impact (what is each surface FOR; what concretely
happens under each reading), and let that decide which side is correct
and which is the mistake to fix. "N instances of an error" is N
violations, not precedent (worked instance 2026-06-27: twelve PDRs
carrying repo-bound references were twelve portability violations, not
licence for a thirteenth).

The constructive face: run the Decision Lenses over an
already-committed, already-reviewed design when a correction signal arrives —
"committed and four-lens-reviewed" is precedence, not immunity. Worked
instance (2026-06-30, the kill-terminal-on-one adjudication): Lens 1 *mandated*
overturning the committed design, lenses 3/4 *refined* the fix from a minimal
patch to the cleaner quorum-floor, and the matrix *retracted* a cost/rigour
"knob" about to be offered (a cheap-cure option caught by the matrix itself).

## Composition

- [`verify-dont-trust`](verify-dont-trust.md) — a claim is true only when its
  proving surface is checked; this rule is its authority dual.
- [`no-tombstones-for-removed-ideas`](no-tombstones-for-removed-ideas.md) — a
  `graduated` or `duplicate` entry leaves only after its home is confirmed; the
  label is precedence, the home-check is the authority.
- [`present-verdicts-not-menus`](present-verdicts-not-menus.md) — do not treat a
  prior annotation as the owner having decided; conversely, once the authority is
  located and the verdict is forced, present it rather than passing it back.
- [`owner-attention-at-action-moments`](owner-attention-at-action-moments.md) —
  when live approval cannot be located and the decision is the owner's, surface
  it as an action-moment instead of acting on a precedent.
