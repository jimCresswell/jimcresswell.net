# Source Is TypeScript, ESM Only

All source code in this repository MUST be TypeScript unless absolutely
impractical. If an action requires a JavaScript file, that file MUST be
compiled from a TypeScript source — never hand-authored (sole
carve-out: the `runtime-only-scripts/` tier, where a build
step is impossible by construction). All JavaScript MUST be ESM; CJS
modules are absolutely not allowed
([`principles.md` §Tooling](../directives/principles.md#tooling)).
Shell is permitted only where it significantly reduces effort
(shell-scope exception, owner-amended 2026-07-06; Husky's hook entry
points are the canonical instance). Owner directive 2026-07-06.

## Trigger

Creating any source or executable file; scaffolding tooling, hooks, or
scripts; reviewing a diff that adds `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, or `.sh`
files.

## Action

- New logic → a `.ts` module in a workspace `src/`, typed, linted, and
  unit-tested.
- A runtime that demands a JS file (a hook target) → compile it from
  TypeScript (the bootstrap-built `agent-tools/dist` pattern); never
  hand-author the compiled artefact.
- A no-compile pre-install constraint (a script that must run before
  `pnpm install` can) → the explicitly-authorised per-workspace
  `runtime-only-scripts/` tier: the named
  absolutely-impractical carve-out where hand-authored `.mjs` is
  required, its extension the deliberate signal of the constrained
  environment.
- Never author a `.cjs` file or CJS-shaped module code (`require`,
  `module.exports`) anywhere — ESM only.
- Shell only where it significantly reduces effort. A shell script that
  accretes parsing or branching logic carries the
  promotion-overdue signals; port it to TypeScript.

Owner sharpening (2026-07-30): the bar for JavaScript exceptions is "high,
high", and an exception never justifies keeping EXISTING hand-authored JS —
surviving `.js` files are rewrite candidates, not grandfathered
(an upstream theme script was rewritten as TypeScript source under this ruling). Shell
and occasional Python remain the only non-TypeScript carve-outs.
