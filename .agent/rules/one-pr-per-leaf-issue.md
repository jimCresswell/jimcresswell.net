# One PR Per Leaf Issue, and the PR Closes It

**HARD RULE.** Deliver a **leaf** issue — one with no children — with **exactly one**
pull request, and close the issue from that PR's body with a closing keyword:
`Fixes <issue>`, or the equivalent `Closes` / `Resolves`, in the tracker's own
form (this estate tracks work in GitHub issues, so `Fixes #nnn`; an estate on a
ticket tracker writes its issue id, such as `Fixes ABC-nnn`). You settle this
twice — cardinality at ticket-scoping time, before a branch exists; the closing
keyword at PR-body authoring time, before the PR is opened. Many leaf issues may
map to one PR; one leaf issue may never map to two. A leaf needing a second PR is
mis-scoped: break it into leaves that each land in one PR, splitting at every
boundary the work crosses — one leaf per repository, in-repo work apart from
out-of-repo work, and decision apart from delivery. `References`, `Refs:`,
`Related:` and a bare issue mention do **not** close; they are correct only
against a parent issue, or a related issue this PR does not deliver, and the PR
must say which. A **parent** issue — including a childless ticket held open as a
durable record — sits outside the one-PR requirement: its children carry the
delivery, so it may carry many PRs, and it closes when its last child leaf closes.

Per [`rules-have-no-exceptions`](rules-have-no-exceptions.md), no convenience case
escapes the requirement.

## Origin

This rule became doctrine by the owner's ruling of 2026-09-02, given in OCE. The
quotation below is that ruling as recorded from chat, its ellipses included. The
operative statement of the rule is the prose above; this quotation is only its
source:

> "for future work it should have at most one PR per issue (unless it's parent issue)
> … so the leaf issues must be 1-1 (or many to one) with a single PR … if not then
> the issue should be broken down … or if the issue requires work across repos or
> some work in repos or outside them again should be split. This should be a HARD
> RULE. PRs should close issues automatically. HARD RULE"

## Trigger

This rule fires at **two** structural moments, and both are load-bearing:

1. **Ticket-scoping time** — minting or re-scoping an issue, briefing a lane,
   designing a stack. The cardinality question is settled here, before a branch
   exists.
2. **PR-body authoring time** — writing the PR body's tracker lines. The closing
   keyword is settled here, before the PR is opened.

Catching it only at the second moment is too late: a leaf issue that needs two PRs
is already mis-scoped by then, and splitting under review pressure is the expensive
path (see [`design-work-for-small-prs`](design-work-for-small-prs.md), whose bands
this rule sits beside rather than inside).

## Action

### 1. Leaf issues are one-to-one with a PR

A **leaf** issue — one with no children — is delivered by **exactly one** PR. Many
leaf issues may map to one PR; one leaf issue may never map to two.

If the work needs more than one PR, **the issue is mis-scoped: break it down** into
leaves that each land in one PR. Do not open a second PR against the same leaf.

### 2. Split across every boundary the work crosses

An issue is split — never stretched — when its work crosses:

- **repositories** (one leaf per repo; a leaf never spans two);
- **the repo boundary itself** — in-repo work and out-of-repo work (a vendor portal,
  a hosting dashboard, an identity provider's console, a knowledge-base page) are
  different leaves, because out-of-repo work has no PR to close it and would
  otherwise hold an in-repo leaf open indefinitely;
- **decision and delivery** — an issue that must be *decided* before it can be
  *built* is two leaves, or a decision leaf under a parent.

### 3. The PR closes the issue automatically

Every PR delivering a leaf names it with a **closing keyword** in the PR body, in
the tracker's form:

```text
Fixes #nnn
```

`Closes` and `Resolves` are equivalent. **`References`, `Refs:`, `Related:` and a
bare issue mention do NOT close** — they attach the PR and leave the issue open
forever unless a human remembers.

`References` remains legitimate for exactly two things, and the PR must say which:

- pointing at a **parent** issue the PR contributes to but does not complete;
- pointing at a **related** issue the PR does not deliver.

A PR whose tracker lines carry only `References` on a **leaf** it in fact delivers
is out of contract, whatever the reason given.

### 4. Parent issues close when their children do

A parent may carry many PRs. It is never closed by a keyword from a child's PR; it
closes when its last child leaf closes. A parent used as a **durable record** (a
domain-move record, a decision register) is a parent for this rule's purposes even
with no children — and its PRs correctly use `References`.

## The failure mode this prevents

**A shipped leaf issue that reads as live work for weeks, indistinguishable from
work nobody has started.**

Worked instance in OCE, measured 2026-09-02. A one-line configuration rename (the
plugin's server key aligned to its product name) was decided by the owner on
2026-08-10 and delivered entirely by one pull request merged about eighty minutes
after the decision. Verified on that estate's default branch: the shipped binding,
the landing-page snippet and its unit test agreed, and the sentinel guard carried
the rewritten comment recording the rename as deliberate. Every acceptance
criterion met.

**The ticket read `In Progress` / `Urgent` for twenty-three days.** The pull
request's tracker lines carried a bare mention ("Owner decision, <ticket>,
2026-08-10") and, on their last line, `Refs: <ticket>, <related ticket>`. Neither
closes. Its branch was named for the fix rather than in the tracker's suggested
branch form, so branch-name linking did not fire either.

The cost was not cosmetic. On 2026-09-01 a colleague commented a decision,
agreeing a decision that had already been made **and shipped three weeks
earlier**. Two people's attention was spent re-deciding finished work, and the
ticket sat on an `Urgent`, pre-publish board four days from a publicity deadline.

**Controls proving the mechanism itself works, so this is a discipline gap and not a
tooling defect:** in the same estate, one pull request carried `Fixes <ticket>` and
that ticket **is** `Done`; another carried `References <ticket>` *deliberately* —
"the ticket stays open as the domain-move record" — and that ticket correctly
stayed open. The integration does exactly what it is told; the mis-scoped pull
request told it nothing.

## Why this is a rule, not a clause

It was considered as a clause on [`design-work-for-small-prs`](design-work-for-small-prs.md)
and rejected. That rule governs changeset **size** (file-count bands) at work-shaping
time; this one governs issue↔PR **cardinality and closure**, and half of it fires at
PR-body-authoring time, which that rule explicitly disclaims ("It does not first fire
at PR-open"). Folding the closing-keyword discipline into a rule about file counts
would bury it where no author looks at the moment it matters.

The two are siblings and reinforce each other: sizing bands make a leaf small enough
to land in one PR; this rule makes that one PR close it.

## Enforcement

Behavioural at both trigger moments today. The reviewable hardening is a PR check
that reddens when a PR body's tracker lines name a **leaf** issue without a
closing keyword — and that check must demand a *stated reason* rather than banning
`References`, because the deliberate `References` above was correct. "Justified
exception" is currently justified to nobody, which is the gap. OCE tracks that
check on its own tracker beside its derived-label action, so it rides one piece of
PR automation rather than two; this estate carries no such check yet.

**Falsifier for this rule**: a leaf issue that genuinely cannot be delivered by one
PR without an indivisible-proof argument of the kind
`design-work-for-small-prs` §indivisibility already recognises. If that shape appears
twice, the cardinality claim is too strong and wants the same proof-shaped exception.
