description: Identify as an agent under shared credentials. When an agent authors outward content (GitHub comments, reviews, PR/issue bodies) via ANY shared credential — the team bot account (the mandatory default per bot-identity-on-third-party-systems) or, in owner-permitted exceptions, the owner's account — it MUST mark the content as agent-authored and name its PDR-027 identity, so the acting agent is never hidden behind the shared account.

# Identify as an Agent Under Shared Credentials

When an agent authors outward-facing content through **shared credentials** —
a human's account, or the team bot account shared by all seats — it MUST
clearly identify itself as the acting agent in that content. A shared
credential attributes the action to the account, not the actor; without an
explicit marker, a reader, collaborator, or audit cannot tell which agent (or
whether a human) authored an artefact, and under a human's account the human
is silently credited with words they did not write.

## Trigger

The agent is about to author or edit any **outward, human-visible artefact**
via shared credentials. In this repository no bot identity exists yet, so every outward write lands
under the owner account (`@jimCresswell`) — the shared-credential case this rule
exists for; the rule fires before:

- a PR or issue **comment** (`gh pr comment`, `gh issue comment`, `gh api
  .../comments`);
- a PR **review** or **review comment** or **review reply** (approve, request
  changes, comment, inline reply);
- a PR or issue **body / description** (`gh pr create`, `gh pr edit`, `gh issue
  create`);
- any other post that lands under the shared account on an external surface.

It also fires when authoring on any non-GitHub outward surface (a vendor
dashboard, external tracker, or published page) through credentials that
identify a human rather than the agent.

## Action

Before posting, attach a clear agent-identification marker to the content. The
marker MUST state three things:

1. that the content is **agent-authored** (not a human-authored message);
2. the agent's **PDR-027 display identity** (the session agent name);
3. that it was posted **via the human account's shared credentials**.

Canonical form — a trailer at the end of the artefact:

```text
---
Agent-authored on behalf of `<account>` by <agent-name> (<platform>, <model>)

Example:
Agent-authored on behalf of `jimCresswell` by Inferno holds Tongs (Claude Code, Opus 4.8 1M)
```

A clearly-visible leading blockquote carrying the same three facts is an
acceptable alternative when a trailer would be missed (e.g. a long PR body). Do
not bury the marker mid-text. If a surface genuinely cannot carry text (e.g. a
bare review approval with no body), add the marker to the accompanying comment
rather than leaving the action unattributed.

If an unattributed artefact has already been posted, **edit it** to add the
marker as soon as the omission is noticed; do not leave it standing.

## Why

The session shares the owner's `gh` auth, so GitHub records every agent action
under the owner's login (see the agent-collaboration directive on identity vs
liveness, and PDR-027 on agent identity). The actor is hidden by construction.
This rule restores honest attribution at the only point that can carry it — the
content itself. It protects:

- **the owner**, from being credited with — or held accountable for — words and
  decisions an agent authored;
- **collaborators and reviewers** (human and bot), who must know whether they
  are in dialogue with a human or an agent to weigh the response correctly;
- **the audit trail**, so a later reader can reconstruct who actually authored a
  decision recorded in a comment or review.

This is the GitHub-surface complement to two mechanisms that already attribute
agent work elsewhere: the `Co-Authored-By` trailer that the
[commit skill](../skills/change-custody/commit/SKILL-CANONICAL.md) adds to commit messages, and
the PDR-027 name+UUID identity that
[`register-identity-on-thread-join`](./register-identity-on-thread-join.md)
carries on internal collaboration state. Outward posts via shared credentials
had no equivalent; this rule closes that gap.

The same asymmetry governs *reading*: for who-did-what questions, consult the
comms event stream and claim dispositions, never a GitHub actor field
(`mergedBy`, PR author, commit pusher) — the login identifies the shared
credential, not the actor (worked instance: PR #160's merge mis-attributed to
the owner from `mergedBy` alone, 2026-06-10). The same applies to comment
audits: agent replies render under the human login in watcher streams and
comment lists, so when auditing "owner comments" on a PR, filter by the
agent-identification marker in the body, never by author login. A leading
`[Agent: …]` prefix is the stronger marker convention for comments — it is
visible in truncated comment lists where a trailing signature is not
(worked instance 2026-07-07).

## Scope Nuance

- **In scope:** outward, human-visible artefacts authored via shared human
  credentials (above).
- **Already covered, do not double-mark:** git commit messages (the
  `Co-Authored-By` trailer is the marker) and internal collaboration-state comms
  (carry PDR-027 name+UUID by construction).
- **Not in scope:** content authored under the agent's *own* distinct account
  (where the actor is already visible) — though a marker there is harmless.
- **In scope (reading side):** attributing past actions performed under shared
  credentials — use the comms stream and claim dispositions, never the GitHub
  actor field (see §Why).

## Enforcement

Behavioural at the authoring moment: the marker is attached before the post
lands, and a missed marker is repaired by editing the artefact. There is no
write-time hook today; a future hardening could lint `gh` invocations or
post-hoc scan shared-account comments for the marker. Until then this is a
no-exceptions discipline ([`rules-have-no-exceptions`](./rules-have-no-exceptions.md)).
