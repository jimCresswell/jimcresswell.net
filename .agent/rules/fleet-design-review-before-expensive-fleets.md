# Fleet design review before expensive fleets

Owner-directed standing practice (2026-08-11): any potentially expensive
fleet — as a working line, one that would exceed the session's default
workflow size guideline, or whose estimated spend crosses ~500k tokens —
has its DESIGN reviewed by a smaller fleet before the owner prices it,
and the design review's verdicts travel with the plan to the
ratification ask. Before ANY fleet launches (owner word 2026-09-07): an
ahead-of-time cost estimate from one measured pilot leg per phase, each times
its phase's fan-out and summed across the phases,
a hand sample of the yield first, no adversarial verify phase where the seat
verifies at application, bounded per-item search, a named tier per phase
with the budget enforced in the script, and those numbers in the launch
record — the section "Ahead-of-time cost estimate, pilot and yield" below
carries each requirement and the measurement behind it. This rule is CORE
(since 2026-09-07): fleets launch from any seat on any platform through
primitives no loader recognises, so the controls load in every session.

## Why (the measured instance)

The first use of this practice paid for itself before it was a rule. The
PR #846 review-fleet plan (2026-08-10, `pr-846-review-fleet`) was
reviewed by a five-leg fleet (~384k tokens, ~7 minutes) ahead of an
estimated 1.5–4.8M-token run, and returned 5/5 *revise* with two
severity-4 design defects, either of which would have wasted or
corrupted the whole spend:

- **The wrong object**: the dispatched diff range (`main...branch`)
  resolved against a stale local `main` to ~906 files instead of the
  PR's ~41 — every leg would have reviewed a 22× contaminated object.
  All five legs caught it independently.
- **Structural false confidence**: refute-by-default empirical
  verification would have systematically killed judgement-class
  findings (frame, doctrine, architecture) and hard-to-reproduce
  browser findings, then reported their absence as verified soundness.

Neither defect was visible to the plan's author — both live in the gap
between the plan's words and the execution environment, which is
exactly where independent eyes are cheapest.

## The practice

1. **Compose the review fleet small and adversarial**: 3–6 legs chosen
   by substance — always `assumptions-expert` (proportionality,
   agent-count warrant) and a frame-challenger; add adversarial
   architecture, test-methodology, and script-mechanics lenses as the
   design's shape demands. Reviewers get the plan file AND first-hand
   access to the execution environment, with the instruction to VERIFY
   the plan's factual claims there (ranges, ports, paths, tool names)
   — the wrong-object class is caught only by resolving the plan's
   words against the real environment.
2. **Adjudicate and revise in place**: every severity-3+ finding cured
   or refuted with evidence; the revision carries a dated note naming
   what changed.
3. **Present with the verdicts attached**: the owner's pricing decision
   sees the review's findings, the cures, and the reviewed cost
   estimate together.

Cheap fleets (a handful of legs, well-trodden shape) do not need this
ceremony — the rule binds where the spend makes a design defect
expensive.

## Briefs centre the question, never the predecessor

A baseline document transmits its STANCE, not only its facts: round-1
census judges handed the 2026-04-28 matrix as their baseline carried its
"keep as thin leaf" editorial stance unratified into their target states,
and the round that centred the question instead produced a dramatically
different result (2026-08-14). A ratification transmits its stance the
same way: briefs seeded with "ratified structure must be respected"
converted surface-with-verdict into defend-the-ruling — every panel
graded the incumbent instead of searching the space (owner diagnosis
2026-08-17, verbatim: "self-congratulatory theater"). When the owner
reopens a space ("the original target architecture was WRONG"), prior
rulings inside it become historical data: write briefs that forbid
deference to anything in the reopened space, admit only first-hand
verified mechanism facts and measurements as evidence, and let prior
decisions enter as ordinary candidates. The anchor-free legs (a cold pass
forbidden the corpus; raw git measurement) were the only parts of that
day's work that survived, and they independently agreed with the owner.
Cure record: `.agent/research/workspace-basis-regrounding-2026-08-17.md`;
the named concept: `patterns/baseline-transmits-its-stance.md`.

Budget the READ traffic. Repo-direct walker legs are dominated by
tool-read tokens, not output: the 2026-08-17 survey round missed its
estimate threefold (3.5M spent against ≤1.1M estimated) because reads
were unpriced. A fleet estimate names its read model per leg.

## A killed builder's seam is re-verified at the next gate tier

Fleet design includes the hand from a builder to its finisher. A builder
killed by quota hands its seam to the NEXT gate tier's re-verify, not only
the tier it died inside: a finisher's "green" omitted the pre-push-only
smoke chain, and the stale fixture literal sat exactly at the original
builder's death seam (2026-08-18). Brief the finisher to re-run every gate
tier above the death point before it reports green.

## Research prompts name the held command classes

A background agent cannot answer a hook's approval prompt: a refuter that
ran a recursive delete inside its own scratch trial held a fifteen-agent
workflow at 14/15 for fifteen minutes (2026-09-03). A research prompt names
the held command classes — recursive deletes, network writes, anything the
hook policy approves interactively — not only "do not modify files"; the
resume from the run id returned the cached agents instantly.

## Ahead-of-time cost estimate, pilot and yield (owner word 2026-09-07)

The owner, on the 2026-09-06/07 mapping fleets: "your dynamic workflows have been
eating tokens at an incredible rate"; the fleet-design documentation "needs to
include ahead of time cost estimates and optimisation". Measured from those runs'
records (about 8.1M tokens for 43 map blocks and 8 record chunks; a verify phase
of 41 legs returning one result; 82k–171k per leg on the session model, 87k per
leg on a cheaper tier with a twelve-call cap):

1. **Cost is set by what enters a leg's context, times its turns.** The unit
   itself (a napkin block of thousand-character lines is 10–15k tokens; a
   record chunk of five-thousand-character lines 30k), the rules, and every tool
   result — each re-sent on every later turn, so tool results dominate. A
   cheaper tier lowers the price per token and never the count; a call cap
   bounds calls, not results. Estimate a leg as (unit tokens + rules) × turns +
   Σ tool-result tokens × turns remaining; size units by tokens (`wc -c` ÷ 4),
   about 8k each.
2. **Pilot before fan-out.** One representative leg per distinct phase (map,
   reduce, verify, synthesis), measured from its run record, times that phase's
   fan-out, summed across phases in the launch record beside the estimate; abort
   when the sum crosses the budget (a single-phase fleet reduces to pilot × N). A resume by run id is a launch: the pilot and yield are re-decided.
3. **Sample the yield by hand first.** Three to five units read at the seat show
   what fraction would move — four fifths of the 2026-09-07 napkin was already
   homed or pure state, a fact a twenty-minute sample would have set before an
   instrument was built. The count chooses the instrument, or no instrument.
4. **No adversarial verify phase behind a first-hand check.** Adversarial
   verification belongs where the consumer would otherwise trust the output
   unread (findings that go straight to a PR); a seat that verifies at
   application makes the phase pure spend.
5. **No open-ended repository search per item.** Legs read the unit and return
   items with a proposed home class; the seat verifies homes with targeted reads
   (a script checks citations mechanically). Where search is allowed, bound it
   by a search command, a per-item read cap and a result-size cap derived in the
   launch record from the measured pilot (the 2026-09-07 instance: `grep -l`
   only, one read of at most sixty lines per item).
6. **Name the tier per phase and enforce a budget in the script** (the workflow
   API's `budget`): the top tier only where judgement is the product; `log()`
   dropped coverage; a stop condition that is not the owner noticing.
7. **The launch record carries the numbers**: estimate, pilot, yield sample,
   tier per phase, budget — and, above the ~500k threshold, this rule's design
   review with its verdict. Runs report tokens, calls, mean and max per phase
   from the run record when they end (a tally row, as the Cricket tally does per
   leg).
