# Lint After Edit

Operationalises [`principles.md` §Code Quality](../directives/principles.md#code-quality).

After editing TypeScript files, check lint for file/function length violations. Run lint on the changed files or run `pnpm lint:fix`. Catch violations early — don't accumulate them.

After each edit pass, run the gates the touched surface requires (`pnpm check`; for the site,
`pnpm --filter @jimcresswell/www test:e2e` or the visual-regression harness when rendering is at
risk). Never disable checks or hand-wave failures; if a fix mutates files, restart the gate
sequence from the top.

Lint the fragment before it joins the whole, and lint every write at once. A commit
header is checkable with `wc -c` and a block about to be appended with markdownlint on
the block file, before either joins the record; a check that runs only on the whole runs
late, and each late refusal cost a commit or a gate run (six in one window, 2026-09-26).
On this repository the pre-push gate reads the WORKING TREE, not the commit: an
uncommitted edit to a tracked file, a stale comms-log projection or an unconsolidated
link fails the next push whoever made the edit, so each write to the shared primary is
linted at once with the gate's own command (`pnpm exec prettier --check --ignore-unknown
-- <files>`, `pnpm exec markdownlint-cli2 --no-globs -- <files>`) and the render is
refreshed before a push.

Key ESLint thresholds that bite during refactoring:

- `max-lines`: 250 lines per file
- `max-lines-per-function`: 50 lines per function
- `complexity`: ESLint counts `??` and `?.` as branches

When a violation appears, follow the refactoring rules in `.agent/directives/principles.md`:

- **File too long**: split by groupings of responsibility; for very long files, turn into a directory with an index.ts integration point.
- **Function too long**: extract named helpers as pure functions with unit tests.
- **Too complex**: extract branch-heavy expressions into pure-function helpers with unit tests.
