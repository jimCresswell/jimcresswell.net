# Pre-Merge Divergence Analysis

Operationalises [`principles.md` §Code Quality](../directives/principles.md#code-quality) — pre-merge type-check is a canonical gate — and [the plan-node estate](../plans/README.md) — plan-level merge strategy lives in the governing delivery plan.

When merging branches that have diverged significantly (100+ files changed
on either side, or 10+ conflicts in a dry-run merge), follow the
[Pre-Merge Divergence Analysis](../reference/pre-merge-analysis.md)
guide before attempting the merge. This rule loads for EVERY merge: the
premise sweep it carries (§Derive Merge Risk, last paragraph) has no size
threshold; the thresholds above select the full divergence workflow only.

The scope is set by the trigger above, not by branch topology: two
long-lived diverged branches (feature-vs-feature, or a stale branch against a
fast-moving `main`) that trip the thresholds. A routine feature-vs-main
ready-check that trips no threshold is a standard pre-merge sanity check
(enumerate the branch's unique commits, check what landed on `main` since the
cut, dry-run the merge) — call it that, and reserve "divergence analysis" for
the threshold-tripping scenario this rule and the `complex-merge` skill own.

Standard text-level conflict resolution misses:

- **Deleted-file import cascades** — a file auto-merges from your branch but
  imports a module the other branch deleted
- **Signature mismatches in auto-merged files** — the other branch changed a
  function signature in a file you didn't touch, but your callers use the old
  signature
- **Required parameter gaps** — your branch adds a required parameter to a
  shared interface, breaking the other branch's new test files that auto-merge
  cleanly
- **Numbering collisions** — both branches create an ADR or plan with the
  same number but different content and different filenames
- **Premise cascades in prose** — the other branch changes a fact (a served
  shape, a published field, a version) that documents and plans on your
  branch state as a premise; their text merges untouched and their meaning
  is now false

Always run `pnpm type-check` immediately after resolving text conflicts —
this catches the silent breaks that Git cannot detect. Type-check proves
code; the generators' own checks prove generated surfaces; nothing proves
prose. Documents and plans are kept true by semantic analysis at every
integration, and this obligation does NOT wait for the thresholds above:
a merge of any size that changes a fact some document states as a premise
owes the sweep. Derive the sweep terms from the incoming change's claims
and read the surfaces the other branch could not have edited (the
[cross-fork integration skill](../skills/change-custody/cross-fork-integration/SKILL-CANONICAL.md)
§6 for a lineage sync, which loads for every sync regardless of size; the
guide's §4i for any other merge that alters a stated premise).

## Derive Merge Risk From Content, Not From Raw Name-Status

Merge and divergence **risk** is content-derived, never read off a raw
`HEAD..origin` (or branch-vs-branch) `--name-status` count. A long
name-status list can be a zero-risk merge (identical content, pure
fast-forward, or already-applied changes) and a short one can hide a
breaking signature change. Prove the risk from the merge algorithm itself
(a dry-run merge, the conflict set) or from an **empty content diff**, not
from how many files appear in a name-status listing. The raw list is a
discovery hint; the verdict comes from the content.

For the full agent-executable workflow, use the
[complex-merge skill](../skills/change-custody/complex-merge/SKILL-CANONICAL.md).

For **agent memory and state files** (`napkin.md`, `repo-continuity.md`, thread
`*.next-session.md` records, registers — anything carrying a `merge_class:`
frontmatter key), the hazard is different in kind: git line-merges silently
corrupt the *meaning* even when no conflict marker appears, and both git AND the
merging agent can be "confident and wrong". Reconcile those by CONCEPT via the
[semantic-merge skill](../skills/change-custody/semantic-merge/SKILL-CANONICAL.md), never by
trusting the conflict count.
