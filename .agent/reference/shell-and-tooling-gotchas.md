# Shell and tooling gotchas (worked, dated, first-hand)

Small operational facts with real bite, each observed live in this
repository. Host-local reference (PDR-007 home class). Add entries with
a date and the observed mechanism; remove entries when the underlying
tool retires them.

## zsh

- **Unquoted leading-`=` words abort compound commands** (3 instances,
  2026-07-20; recurred 2026-09-09 at a seat running five chained reads —
  the cure that holds is one plain command per call, the
  `worktree-residency` rule's working shape, which PR #100's pending
  unattended-seats rule restates for every seat). `echo ===X===` in a chained command errors and kills the
  REMAINING chained commands invisibly: zsh's default `EQUALS` option
  performs command-path expansion on an unquoted word beginning with
  `=` (the `=cmd` form). Quote the separator or emit it with `printf`.
- **`GID` is a READONLY integer parameter in zsh** (2026-07-20).
  Assigning a uuid to it fails as "bad math expression"; never use it
  as a variable name (same family: `UID`, `EUID`, `EGID`).

## Repo tooling

- **Filesystem probes use absolute paths — a persistent shell cwd fakes
  vanished files** (2026-07-26): after a `cd` into a workspace, a
  root-relative `ls .agent/experience/` reports "no such directory" while
  the file exists, and a `find` from the same cwd "confirms" the vanish. A
  vanished-file conclusion needs a root-anchored (absolute-path) check
  before it is a conclusion.
- **Prettier must run with the target worktree as cwd** (2026-07-20): a
  root-anchored relative path from a reset shell cwd silently formats
  the wrong checkout (one pre-commit red before diagnosis).
- **`node_modules/.pnpm/<pkg>@*` listings read store RESIDUE** (2026-07-25):
  the pnpm store keeps prior installs' versions, so a glob listing after a
  bump can read back the OLD version while the bump worked perfectly.
  Verify a resolved version with `pnpm why <pkg>` or the lockfile, never a
  store-directory listing.
- **Branch-switch stale-dist brick** (2026-07-20): after switching a
  checkout between branches whose `@engraph/result` dist differs,
  `pnpm install`'s bootstrap fails on the stale dist and every filtered
  build recurses into the same failing install. Escape:
  `PRACTICE_SKIP_AGENT_TOOLS_BOOTSTRAP=1 pnpm install`, then the filtered
  package build, then plain install.
- **pnpm-wrapped CLI invocations die at postinstall during source
  breakage** (2026-07-21): while the tree is broken, `pnpm <script>`
  forms of the agent-tools CLI fail at bootstrap; direct
  `node agent-tools/dist/...` (or `pnpm exec tsx` on source) is the
  resilient path — valid only while dist+deps stay coherent.

## Repo CLI (agent-tools)

- **`comms send` takes NO `--kind` flag** (2026-07-21): event kind is
  not caller-settable; the usage line is truth, not the event schema's
  kind vocabulary.
- **`claims adopt` requires the FULL claim UUID** (2026-07-21): the
  8-char prefix used throughout records and doctrine is rejected with
  "no active claim matches".
- **`claims heartbeat` and `claims close` require explicit `--now`**
  while `claims open` defaults it (three instances, 2026-07-20..23) —
  the per-command now-defaulting inconsistency, F-89 family.

- **`merge-bot mint-token` has no direct-run bootstrap** (2026-07-25, two
  seats): BOTH direct node entries (tsx on source and node on the built
  cli.js) exit 0 with empty streams on the MINT path — a silent exit-0 on a
  token-minting path. The working entry is `pnpm --silent agent-tools
  merge-bot mint-token --scope <name>` (docs/engineering/merge-bot.md).
  Scoped to the mint path deliberately: since MCP-385 the direct node entry
  DOES exit 2 with a proper stderr message on a `--scope` usage failure
  (verified 2026-07-29), so the blanket "always exit 0" reading is no longer
  true of every path.
- **A failing mint inside `GH_TOKEN=$(…) gh …` runs as the HUMAN**
  (2026-07-29): the substitution yields an empty string, `gh` treats an empty
  `GH_TOKEN` as unset, and it falls back to the keyring — silently executing
  as the signed-in, possibly bypass-capable account. Assign first and stop on
  failure (`token=$(…) || exit 1`); never the prefix form. See
  `.agent/rules/bot-identity-on-third-party-systems.md`.
- **Workflow-resume caches can serve degenerate results** (2026-07-25): a
  quota-wall degradation produced literal placeholder schema-fills
  ("test") that a later resume would have cache-served as valid — inspect
  the journal's actual return values for degenerate output before
  trusting a workflow resume cache.

## GitHub Actions

- **A workflow existing only on a non-default branch is not dispatchable**
  (2026-07-23, single instance, mechanism inferred): no registration
  appeared after ~15 min. Working cure: `on: push` scoped to its own
  scratch ref — the push event runs the file at that ref immediately.
  Scaffold → evidence → delete-ref, proven on the Slack alert test.

## GitHub credential

- **gh-token invalidation masquerades as rate-limiting** (3+ instances,
  2026-07-13..20): anonymous-tier limits (`limit: 60`) after a 401 are
  the signature; `gh auth status` is the discriminator. Never diagnose
  "quota exhausted" from 403s alone; empty/failing gh reads are
  transport-down, not no-news. Fleet cure: stop polling, keep
  SSH-git/local work, one owner card for the interactive re-auth.

## Git craft

- **Cut-branch roll-ups from the primary use the UNBUNDLED form**
  (2026-07-21, owned violation): `git branch <name>` (pointer only, no
  switch) + `git push origin <name>` + `gh pr create --head <name>`.
  The muscle-memory `checkout -b` bundles create+switch and moves the
  shared primary; `git branch --show-current` after every
  branch-affecting command is the cheap tripwire.

## Markdown

- **A wrapped prose line starting with `+ ` reads as a list marker**
  (markdownlint MD004/MD032, 2026-07-23): reflowing prose so a
  continuation line begins with `+` (e.g. "…inputs X\n+ the report…")
  turns it into an unordered-list item in the wrong style. Reword to
  "and"/"plus" or rewrap.
- **Prettier pads a markdown table to its widest cell, so editing the widest
  cell realigns every row** (2026-09-07, the rules index: a one-cell edit
  became a 254-line diff twice). Fit the new text to the column's current
  width — prettier's own count, one wider than a naive character count
  where the cell holds an em dash — then `prettier --write` restores the
  single-line diff; recovering the file from the index is hook-refused, so
  measure first.

## Git hooks

- **husky names the failing STAGE only in its last line** (2 misreads,
  2026-07-21): a commit-msg failure (e.g. a >100-char subject) reads
  like a gate failure until the final `husky - <hook> script failed`
  line is read literally. Read that line before diagnosing; the
  pre-draft `check-commit-message` step in the commit skill collapses
  the whole layer.

## 2026-07-30 consolidation batch (each measured first-hand in the 07-24→30 window)

- **zsh does not word-split unquoted variables** (third monitor-recipe
  instance — the row is now owed): `for c in $CLAIMS` iterates ONCE with
  the whole string; four GraphQL ids went as one malformed argument.
  Iterate literal values or `printf '%s\n' … | while read`. Sibling:
  `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` is a bashism that expands EMPTY in zsh (whose array is
  the lowercase, 1-based `pipestatus`) — the piped-exit trap in a fourth
  costume.
- **pnpm re-appends the literal `--` at EACH forwarding layer**: a root
  alias forwarding through a workspace script delivers `['--', …]` to the
  leaf bin, and an arg scanner reading leading `--` as its terminator sees
  nothing. Drop the `--`; smoke the full script chain shell-level.
- **turbo parses bare `--force` as value-taking** and eats the task name
  (`turbo run --force sdk-codegen` runs nothing); use `--force=true`.
- **`spawnSync` timeout sets BOTH `error` (ETIMEDOUT) and `signal`** — an
  error-first branch swallows the captured streams the signal branch's
  diagnostics were added for; compose stream excerpts into both.
- **`join(root, dir)` silently mangles absolute dirs** (`join('/repo',
  '/abs')` → `/repo/abs`); `resolve(root, dir)` is the cure; every
  path-taking CLI option earns one absolute-input test.
- **esquery selector regexes mute on raw slashes**: `Literal[value=/a//]`
  parses and lint runs green but the selector NEVER fires (the `/`
  delimiter truncates it). Escape `/` inside `String.raw`, write
  escape-bearing config via a script, and prove it with a negative
  control (tmp file with the banned literal → expect the error).
- **A backtick in an inline `--body` is a live command substitution**:
  zsh executed a phrase out of a doctrine sentence mid-send and the event
  landed mangled at exit 0. `--body-file` is the only quoting-safe
  transport for non-trivial bodies.
- **`git add -- <deleted-path>` fatals (exit 128) when the deletion is
  already staged** — pathspec matches nothing and the whole add aborts;
  add only paths that exist on disk. And `git status --porcelain`
  collapses untracked DIRECTORIES — enumerating files needs `-uall`.
- **BSD grep -E has no `\s`** and a mis-quoted retry can still undercount
  with a clean exit — calibrate any counting instrument against a KNOWN
  count first; prefer a real parse (`matchAll`) over line-regex on
  structured sources.
- **Codex seat salvage paths**: a stopped Codex seat's opening prompt
  (including any relayed predecessor plan) survives verbatim in
  `~/.codex/history.jsonl` and `~/.codex/sessions/<date>/rollout-*.jsonl`;
  distilled tenure summaries in `~/.codex/memories/rollout_summaries/`.
  A 6-char PDR-027 prefix can span MULTIPLE relaunched platform sessions —
  prefix-identity is coarser than session-identity at the platform layer.
- **Google Docs under browser automation**: the canvas editor swallows
  synthetic input while the tool reports success — treat Docs as
  READ-ONLY (deliver content as paste-ready blocks). The `/mobilebasic`
  render is the reliable read surface, but it renders ACCEPTED text only:
  an absence verdict ("the doc lacks X") also requires the
  comment/suggestion history panel, where a full draft section can live
  invisible to mobilebasic. The write-side dual: Google Docs SYNTHETIC
  TYPING silently fails — the automation tool reports success while the
  document stays untouched — so mobilebasic is the reliable READ path and
  browser-automation writes into Docs need an independent read-back
  verification before any "written" claim.
- **An open-range dependency override (`>=X`) is a standing exposure, not
  a one-shot test subject**: its resolution is a moving target, so a
  survivability test can pass at authoring and fail a day later with zero
  repo changes (measured: froze at 4.0.40 on the 29th, floated to 5.0.14
  breaking two more packages on the 30th). The cheapest durable state is
  not having the override.
- **Grepping a shipped binary needs `LC_ALL=C`** or grep reports a false
  "binary file matches" zero-hit read; registry semantic hashes are
  computable via a temp tsx file inside the package dir importing
  `./semantic-source-sha256.js`; and a newline-joined variable passed to
  git reads as ONE pathspec — use `xargs`, and verify with a staged-count
  check.
- **Operational signatures worth knowing** (2026-07-30): a model tier can
  change WITHIN a session id, so tuple-matchers keyed on (session, model)
  mis-match across the change; a write command is never a probe (a stray
  all-zeros event id traced to an argument-validation "probe" that was
  actually a write); and the security-headers integration test's
  `Parse Error: Expected HTTP/, RTSP/ or ICE/` was ROOT-CAUSED (MCP-403,
  superseding the earlier "loaded-host flake" reading): supertest servers
  bind `::` (IPv6-any) while clients dial `127.0.0.1`, and a resident
  macOS Java listener on the colliding port answered the mismatch — the
  cure is the loopback-request test helper binding client and server to
  the same explicit loopback. A gate failure in a package the diff never
  touched is still a re-run candidate first, but this signature now has a
  named cause.
- **Under an inherited `COREPACK_ROOT` the resolved standalone pnpm refuses
  the `packageManager` self-switch** (observed on an 11.9.0-resolved pnpm
  against an 11.8.0 pin): strip the corepack env (`env -u COREPACK_ROOT …`
  or a clean shell) so the pin resolves its own binary.
- **Analytics/event-store retention config is free to fix only BEFORE first
  collection**: before any event lands it is a settings change; after, it
  is a deletion exercise with data-governance weight. The free-to-fix
  window closes at the first event — configure retention in the same
  change that enables collection.
- **Two whole-repo gate suites racing on one checkout can strand a Next
  build lock**: `next build` refuses with "Another next build process is
  already running" even after the racing process is gone (observed when a
  peer's pre-commit gate overlapped a merge-commit gate on the shared
  primary, 2026-07-31). Check `pgrep -fl "next build"` — if nothing is
  live, the lock is stale residue and ONE retry succeeds; the singleton
  gate-runner discipline is the prevention.
- **A Vercel function boot-throw serves 500 `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`
  with ZERO runtime logs** — the throw happens before the logger exists,
  so "no logs" is itself the signature: check module-load/boot-path code
  (top-level awaits, config reads, imports) before instrumenting the
  handler.

## 2026-09-02 fold-carry batch (2026-08-19 instances carried at the fold merge)

- **zsh arrays are 1-indexed.** A `for i in 0 1 …` over `declare -a`
  silently dropped element 0 (one review thread unreplied, caught by the
  in-band NOT_FOUND error). Iterate the array itself, never numeric
  indices, in this shell.
- **zsh no-word-split, census edition** (recurrence of the row above,
  2026-09-02): a grep census over a space-joined path list in `$H`
  returned NONE for every probe because grep searched one nonexistent
  path and `2>/dev/null` hid the error. An all-NONE census is a probe
  failure until one known-positive probe in the set reads a hit — carry
  a positive control in every census.
- **JSX attribute strings decode HTML entities.** Both SWC and esbuild
  turn `"&mdash;"` into an em dash in attribute literals — a reviewer
  finding built on "string props render literally" was premise-false.
  Verify transform-level claims AT the transform, not from the JSX
  mental model.

## 2026-09-06 consolidation batch (2026-09-02→06 instances, each measured first-hand by the seat named in the napkin)

- **pnpm forwards a literal `--` to some scripts as an unknown flag.**
  `pnpm agent-tools:check-commit-message -- -F <file>` exits 2; feed the
  message on stdin (`< "$MSGFILE"`) or pass `-F` without the `--`
  (2026-09-03).
- **A rename through the version-control CLI stages both endpoints.** A
  later staging call naming the deleted path refuses ("did not match any
  files") and aborts the WHOLE pathspec add; after a move, stage the live
  paths only (2026-09-03).
- **A stale commit-queue intent blocks the next guard.** An intent that was
  enqueued and never committed (a failed guard, an abandoned ceremony)
  makes every later guard on overlapping files refuse with "multiple fresh
  matching commit-queue intents" until `phase --intent-id … --phase
  abandoned` (2026-09-03; 2026-09-06, frictions F-172).
- **commitlint `subject-case` rejects an uppercase token right after the
  type**: a subject beginning "ADR-227 …" fails; lead with a lowercase word
  (2026-09-03).
- **A markdown line opening with `#959's` is an ATX heading** to
  markdownlint (MD018); write `PR #959's` (2026-09-03).
- **zsh globs an unquoted `--include=*.md`** before grep sees it and fails
  with "no matches found"; quote the pattern (2026-09-05).
- **`claude mcp logout <name>` cannot see a server disabled in settings or
  whose plugin is off**: it answers "No MCP server named" for every disabled
  server. Order a disconnect clear-tokens-then-disable (2026-09-03, Claude
  Code 2.1.25x).
- **`vercel whoami` after `vercel logout` blocks on an interactive login
  prompt**: a batched logout chain timed out on it and the later commands
  never ran. CLI logouts run one per call, stdin closed, under `timeout`
  (2026-09-03).
- **The harness re-injects a nested checkout's rule pointers on every read
  under it.** One 2026-08 transcript holds 1,056 nested-memory attachments
  across eight worktrees under the repository's own platform worktree
  directory, naming 121 distinct rule files (separate counts; the per-worktree
  split was not retained) — the measured mechanism behind "the rules load
  twice" (2026-09-05).
- **The bot merge token expires hourly**; a 401 mid-batch is the tell —
  mint, then repeat the batch (2026-09-05).
- **`ls -1` hides dotfiles**, so it reports a just-copied dotfile as absent.
  **The ignore-check verb prints the matching pattern for a NEGATED path
  too**, so its output cannot say whether a file is ignored — ask the
  status command what the tree actually sees. **A background task's "exit
  code 0" is the wrapper's status**, not the command's. **A validator's
  file flag was `-F`, not `--file`** — read the tool's help before guessing
  the flag (experience letter, the MCP submission drive, 2026-08).
- **`cd` inside one Bash call persists into the next call.** The identity
  preflight and the bot token mint both resolve the repository from the
  working directory and fail outside the worktree ("not a git repository"
  → IDENTITY PREFLIGHT FAILED / TOKEN MINT FAILED); use absolute paths and
  never change directory (2026-09-04, relative paths reading "file
  missing" after one directory change; 2026-09-06, twice in one window).
- **A lowercase `path` variable clobbers PATH in zsh.** zsh ties the
  lowercase `path` array to `PATH` (likewise `cdpath`, `fpath`, `manpath`),
  so `path=…` in a loop silently empties PATH and every later binary reports
  "command not found" until a fresh call; name scratch variables anything
  else (2026-09-04).
- **A comms append is a transactional touch on the claims registry.** The
  `collaboration-state comms append` path reads the active-claims file
  through the migrating reader, so the first CLI use after a rebuild runs
  any pending one-time registry migration: on 2026-09-04 the 1.3.0 → 1.4.0
  queue split ran under a merge-landed broadcast, seconds after the
  rebuilt dist appeared and BEFORE the planned by-hand archive copy, so no
  pre-migration copy of that day's file exists. Take the archive copy
  before ANY CLI call after a rebuild — a comms send included.

## 2026-09-07 consolidation batch (2026-09-02→07 instances, each measured first-hand by the seat named in the napkin and verified at the drain)

- **The Actions runs listing returns at most 1,000 results per query and
  raises no error at the cap** (2026-09-02): a day with 1,325 runs produced
  a 1,000-line file and a clean exit, found only against the endpoint's own
  `total_count`. Count each window with `per_page=1`, split any day over the
  cap into sub-day `created` windows, and record per-day coverage.
- **A bot installation token is a second 5,000-requests-per-hour core bucket
  for read-only Actions pulls** (2026-09-02): two shards, one under the `gh`
  login and one under a minted installation token, ran side by side over a
  17,467-run export; the token lasts an hour, so the pull ran under a
  re-mint-and-resume wrapper on each timeout exit (124).
- **The Actions performance-metrics page under Insights has no REST
  endpoint** (2026-09-02): its per-workflow and per-job counts, run and
  queue times and failure rates are derivable from `actions/runs` and
  `actions/runs/{id}/jobs?filter=all` (queue time = job `started_at −
  created_at`; run time = `completed_at − started_at`; every attempt under
  `run_attempt`); the page's CSV is a manual download.
- **A format or lint run over an unquoted space-joined variable silently
  widens** (2026-09-03, the no-word-split family): `prettier --write $FILES`
  exited 2 on one nonexistent path; `markdownlint` over the same string
  linted the whole tree, so its verdict said nothing about the named files.
  Literal paths, one variable per file.
- **`validate-markdown-links` reads a link from a tracked source to an
  untracked new file as broken** and labels it
  `tracked-source-to-untracked-target` (2026-09-03): a new ADR plus its
  index row was red in the working tree and green once the new file was
  staged. Stage the new file first, or read the reason label.
- **A workflow fan-out stalled at N−1 of N is a held approval, not a slow
  agent** (2026-09-03): the journal's `started` versus `result` counts name
  the missing agent; its newest transcript ends on a Bash tool use with no
  result; no process is running. A hook-held command inside a background
  agent has no approver — stop the run, name the held command class in the
  prompt, resume from the run id (the cached agents return instantly).
- **`gh repo view` takes the repository as a positional argument and has no
  `--repo` flag** (2026-09-06).
- **`comms send --body` caps at 1,500 characters** (`MAX_COMMS_BODY_LENGTH`,
  2026-09-06); `--body-file` beyond it.
- **`gh api --jq` has no `--arg`**: interpolate values in the shell before
  the jq expression (2026-09-06).
- **A GitHub CheckRun still in progress carries no `conclusion`**
  (2026-09-06): read `(.conclusion // .state // "") == ""` as pending, never
  as absent or failed, or a green-by-name check read lies.
- **`merge-bot push` runs the full pre-push chain and takes minutes; three
  chains in parallel put the host at load 17** (2026-09-06) — the
  measurement behind the owner's host bound of two, at most three,
  simultaneous full local gates (2026-09-07).
- **`gitleaks detect --no-git` did not report a synthetic credential that
  git-mode scanning caught**, inside a file named by an AND-conditioned
  allowlist (gitleaks 8.30.1, 2026-09-06): a scanner-mode difference to
  verify per invocation, not a defect to route upstream unreproduced.
- **A zero from a probe is a probe failure until a known positive is in the
  set** (2026-09-06, the second instance that week): an xlsx written with
  the `x:` namespace prefix hid `<x:f>` formula tags from a bare `<f` grep,
  and a URL extractor's quoting matched nothing against real content.
- **`/code-review ultra` (`/ultrareview`) refuses 21 files / 16,235 lines
  and is owner-triggered only** (2026-09-06): run the link-closure census
  before any fixture branch, not after two abandoned attempts.
- **Prettier's `resolveConfig` returns null from a path outside the
  repository** (2026-09-06): a self-check resolving from its own output
  directory validated nothing until it resolved from the script's own
  location.
- **A `;`-joined chain runs every step regardless of the previous exit**
  (2026-09-06): a commit refused by the commit-msg hook (a 101-character
  header) did not stop the chain; the push moved nothing and a reply script
  posted, on three threads, a cure SHA the head did not carry. Gate every
  dependent step on the prior exit, and measure the header before the
  ceremony.
- **Some publishers answer 403 to a scripted fetch or HEAD** (2026-09-05,
  the evidence publisher's terms page to the harness fetcher; 2026-09-07,
  seven of twenty load-bearing citations to a scripted HEAD): a 403 to a bot
  is not a dead link and the honest verdict is "unverified by probe"; a page
  a seat cannot read first-hand has its terms carried in the artefact's
  metadata instead.
- **The reference-direction validator refuses a directive that links into
  `.agent/memory/**`** (patterns included; the #59 cure commit's hook,
  2026-09-06): doctrine names a pattern in backticks, never as a link.
- **A lane touching a `DELTA_SCOPE_PATHS` entry of the MCP current-source ledger runs
  `validate-mcp-content-current-source` as a lane gate before the ceremony** (2026-09-06):
  package gates never invoke it, so the pre-commit hook was the first place it fired and it
  refused the projection's first commit outright ("Reviewed semantic-delta files differ",
  eleven files). Cure shape: one review-ledger file per concern with an `excluded(...)`
  disposition and the semantic hash for each affected file, wired into the aggregator, then
  `refresh-mcp-content-current-source-anchors`.
- **The pre-push turbo step can replay a cached agent-tools test pass when only a root
  file changed** (2026-09-07): `tests/rules/rules-index-classification.unit.test.ts` reads
  `RULES_INDEX.md`, but the root `test` task declares only package-local inputs
  (`$TURBO_DEFAULT$`, `**/*.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`), so an edit to the index does not
  invalidate the cache — the pre-push log read `agent-tools:test: cache hit, replaying
  logs` while CI, running cold, failed the new core row's explaining trigger cell (the test
  requires the bare em dash): one CI cycle and one extra push on a terminal PR. Run the
  dedicated directory before the push (`pnpm exec vitest run tests/rules/` from
  `agent-tools/`, about 100 ms); the structural cure is declaring the root file among the
  task's inputs (`$TURBO_ROOT$/RULES_INDEX.md`, the form `tsconfig.base.json` already uses).
- **The skill-adapter projection check refuses a push whose skill reference changed
  without regenerated projections** (2026-09-07): an edit under a skill's `references/`
  needs `pnpm skills:generate` first, and the regenerated `.claude/skills/` and
  `.agents/skills/` copies travel in the same push.
- **The reference-direction validator also refuses a permanent doc that links to a plan
  node** (PDR-105; the second class after the `.agent/memory/**` one above, 2026-09-07):
  an ADR linking its delivery plan was refused at pre-commit. Doctrine states its own
  contract self-contained; a plan is named in prose at most, never linked.

## 2026-09-09 consolidation batch (2026-09-07→09 instances, each measured first-hand by the seat named in the napkin and verified at the drain)

- **`gh pr list --search` with a head-name query returns nothing, silently**
  (2026-09-09, the carrier check): filter server-side with `--head <branch>`
  (gh 2.97.0: "Filter by head branch"); any listing you read as "the full open
  list" needs an explicit `--limit`, because the default page is thirty and the
  command raises no error at the cap.
- **A `git grep` over a pathspec built by substitution gave different counts on
  two runs** (8 files, then 0; 2026-09-09): one term at a time in the plain form
  `git grep <term> <ref> -- '*.md'`.
- **The bot's push leaves the remote-tracking ref stale** (2026-09-09):
  `git fetch origin <branch>` before any `-d` or `rev-list` against it, or the
  ancestry proof reads the pre-push ref.
- **`git add -- <old> <new>` after a `git mv` exits 128 (`pathspec '<old>' did
  not match any files`), and a pathspec commit that omits the old path leaves it
  tracked-but-missing** (2026-09-08, the fold; Git 2.43). The sequence that
  works: `git mv` has already staged the rename, so `git add -- <new>` alone,
  then name BOTH endpoints in the commit pathspec (`git commit -- <old> <new>`)
  so the deletion is recorded. The commit skill's staging step still tells the
  reader to `git add` both endpoints — a pointer for its next records pass; the
  Director's fold script of that day worked around it by skipping absent paths
  at its add step while keeping them in the queue intent.
- **markdownlint MD028 fires on consecutive blockquotes without a separator**
  (2026-09-08): blank line, `---`, blank line. **MD018 fires on a wrapped line
  that begins with a PR number** (`#674)`, `#96`; 2026-09-08 and 2026-09-09):
  never let a reflow put `#NN` at a line start.
- **A moved record's relative links change depth** (2026-09-08): the links
  validator names the fix; run it before the push after any move.
- **`comms reply` refuses an unknown antecedent event id** (2026-09-08), and
  `comms show` refuses the 8-character prefix records use (2026-09-09); but
  `comms direct --in-response-to` copies whatever string it is given into the
  event unvalidated (the command's own integration test threads to a
  nonexistent id by design), so a caller verifies that full id against the
  store first or the threading edge dangles. Read ids from the store, never
  from memory.
- **The auto-mode permission classifier refused a Monitor arm and a one-shot cron
  identical in shape to ones it had allowed minutes earlier** (2026-09-08,
  2026-09-09): a refusal is not a verdict on the command — retry once with the
  same shape, then route it.
- **A subagent's final result is truncated at about 16,000 characters in the
  idle notification** (2026-09-09, four of five reviewers): put a scratchpad
  path in the original brief and ask for the report on disk plus a one-line
  pointer; a follow-up message asking for the file worked first time.
- **The merge-bot App's installation token cannot re-run a workflow job**
  (`Resource not accessible by integration`; 2026-09-08 and 2026-09-09): the
  bot-legitimate re-trigger is an empty-commit push, outside the review budget;
  the Actions write permission is the owner's grant.
- **`apt` fetching Google's chrome-stable index returned "Hash Sum mismatch" at
  the Playwright install step** — three consecutive `browser-tests` reds in
  sixteen minutes (2026-09-09): an external-mirror class; re-run after it
  settles, never a push to fix; the OS-deps step is the surface to make resilient
  if it recurs.
- **The statusline log path resolves relative to the session's persistent cwd**
  (2026-09-09): after a `cd … && sed` left the cwd under `.agent/skills/cognition`,
  the log wrote `.agent/skills/cognition/.logs/statusline.log` every ten seconds
  and the skills generator refused the dot-directory under the skill tiers, so
  every push from the repository failed until the cwd returned to the root. Never
  `cd` in a call; absolute paths only.
- **A `.git/index.lock` collision with a peer's `git worktree add` in the same
  second aborts the ceremony cleanly** (2026-09-08): the lock is gone on
  inspection; re-run.
- **A fresh worktree has no `.husky/_` until install runs** (2026-09-09): a commit
  made before install runs no commit-msg or pre-commit hook and reads as if the
  gate passed.
- **The write hook fingerprints a user-home absolute path inside a file's
  CONTENT** (2026-09-05, 2026-09-06, 2026-09-09): scripts and records derive paths
  at runtime (`git worktree list`, `git rev-parse`, `mktemp -d`) or use
  repo-relative and sibling-relative paths.
- **A pre-authored apply script's match strings drift by the time they run**
  (2026-09-08, two words): re-read against the landed file before running; the
  dry run proved the old text, not the landed one.
- **The wrap cron fires only in an idle REPL** (2026-09-09): a night of
  notifications kept a Director's loop busy at the minute and the tick never
  arrived, so a dirty continuity line sat for an hour — a dirty continuity line
  is swept at the next quiet moment, cron or not.
