# Reference

Curated, owner-vetted read-to-learn material for agents and the humans working
with them (the Reference tier in `orientation.md`; promotion-gated per
PDR-032). These files are local support docs, not part of the travelling
Practice Core. Each entry is consulted on demand, never read at session open.
When a file is added, moved or dropped, this index changes in the same commit.
