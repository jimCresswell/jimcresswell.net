# Comms Watch Mechanism — Portable Reference

Event-driven all-channel comms intake for agent sessions, with an explicit
liveness-attestation seam.

## Purpose

`comms watch` is the canonical event-driven mechanism by which an agent
session observes broadcast, group, directed, observed, and lifecycle comms
without polling. It runs alongside the agent's reasoning loop; host-specific
notification composition determines whether its output wakes that loop.

Watcher delivery and agent notification are separate contracts. A watcher
can discover an event, emit it, and mark it seen while the reasoning harness
remains unaware. Events reach the agent's notice surface only through a
host-specific notification composition; record its verified latency per
platform. Printed output alone does not prove wake-up.

## Substrate model

The collaboration substrate is an **append-only event log** in a
directory. Each event is a JSON file:

```text
.agent/state/collaboration/comms/<event-uuid>.json
```

A rendered narrative log (for human-friendly reading) is derived
from those event files; the per-event files are authoritative.
Anyone appends; everyone reads. The substrate does not enumerate
event types at schema level — readers filter for what they care
about.

The common envelope across all event kinds carries:

- `schema_version`
- `event_id` (stable unique identifier; UUID v4 or stable slug)
- `created_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp, host-clock anchored)
- `kind` (`narrative`, `lifecycle`, or `directed`)
- `body` (free-form)

Author and routing fields depend on `kind`: narrative events use `author`
with optional `audience` / `addressed_to`; directed events use `from` /
`to`; lifecycle events use `author` and the lifecycle subject's
`agent_id`. The canonical field contract is
[`agent-tools/src/collaboration-state/schemas/comms-event.schema.json`](../../agent-tools/src/collaboration-state/schemas/comms-event.schema.json).

## Watch contract

A watcher takes:

- the comms directory path,
- the watcher's own identity tuple (for self-exclusion only — NOT
  an addressee filter; see step 2 below and the
  [`start-right-team` SKILL §0](../skills/start-right-team/SKILL-CANONICAL.md)
  all-channels-matter contract),
- a path to a per-session "seen events" file (tracks which event
  ids have already been delivered to this session, so a restart
  does not re-deliver),
- optionally: a clock and a heartbeat sink (see "Liveness" below).

On each filesystem-change tick:

1. Enumerate event files under the comms directory.
2. Emit every event with **self-exclusion plus the sanctioned
   tag-exclusion mechanism only** — events authored by the watcher's
   own identity tuple are dropped (self-exclusion is non-negotiable —
   a watcher that echoes its own writes as inbound creates a feedback
   loop that contaminates the agent's reasoning context), and events
   suppressed by the F-146 `--exclude-tag` surface (ADR-183 tags;
   addressed events always surface; excluded events still mark seen —
   see [`comms-all-channels-watcher`](../rules/comms-all-channels-watcher.md)
   §"Sanctioned tag exclusion") are marked without emission.
   **Hand-rolled and addressee filtering are forbidden**: the
   comms event stream is canonical truth, and broadcast, group,
   directed-to-self, observed (cross-traffic), and lifecycle views
   all carry coordination substance the agent needs. The agent's
   reasoning layer triages relevance, not the watcher boundary. An
   event whose addressee is another agent surfaces under the
   `[OBSERVED]` view-token so the agent knows the channel at a
   glance.
3. Exclude event ids already recorded in the seen-events file.
4. Emit new events to the agent's notice surface.
5. Append the delivered event ids to the seen-events file.
6. If a heartbeat sink is configured, call it once per tick with
   `{ last_heartbeat_at, last_heartbeat_source }` so a separate
   liveness surface can record that the watcher is alive.

The watcher is a separate process or coroutine from the agent's
main loop. It does not call the agent; it appends to a notice
surface the agent reads.

## Notification-path verification

Verifying all three legs is required for every host integration:

1. **Delivery** — `comms watch` discovers the event.
2. **Emission** — the event reaches the watcher's output or notice sink.
3. **Wake-up** — the reasoning harness is notified and can absorb the event
   without user steering.

Seen-file advancement and emitted stdout prove only the first two legs.
Process liveness and heartbeat freshness prove that the watcher process is
alive, which is a separate concern (see [Liveness](#liveness-the-heartbeat-source-attribution-pattern)).
None of these signals proves wake-up.

On GitHub Copilot CLI 1.0.75, a long-lived watcher running through detached
Bash writes new events to the detached process's captured stdout but does
not wake the harness when that output arrives; the runtime notifies only when
the process completes. Copilot CLI has no Monitor-equivalent primitive for
this stream, so the general Bash-background limitation in
[`use-monitor-for-event-driven-wake`](../rules/use-monitor-for-event-driven-wake.md)
cannot be cured through the normal Monitor route.

Until that capability changes, a Copilot CLI team session MUST apply
[`start-right-team`'s periodic comms cadence](../skills/start-right-team/SKILL-CANONICAL.md#5-maintain-the-team-cadence)
through a scheduler-driven alert check:

- keep `comms watch` running for all-channel delivery, cursor durability, and
  liveness;
- at no more than the 120-second fallback cadence, read canonical comms events
  using a separate alert cursor — a bookmark the scheduled check owns and
  advances only after the harness has absorbed an event;
- never use the watcher's seen-events file as the alert cursor, because the
  watcher marks an event seen before the harness has absorbed it;
- prioritise directed and group messages, while still inspecting substantive
  broadcasts and observed routing per the all-channels contract.

Initialise the alert cursor from the last **proven harness-absorbed** event. If
the check takes over from a frozen watcher, apply the
[`comms-all-channels-watcher` dormancy-cursor discipline](../rules/comms-all-channels-watcher.md#dormancy-polls-initialise-their-cursor-from-the-frozen-seen-file).
If the watcher continued marking events while the harness was unaware, first
reconcile the gap and only then seed the alert cursor; copying the watcher's
current seen-file would preserve the miss.

A host whose native monitor forwards incremental output as agent notices does
not need this extra scheduled check. Verify the capability by sending a
directed test event and confirming that it creates an agent turn without a
manual poll or user prompt. A live process that merely prints the event fails
this acceptance check.

Codex pairs a root-identity watcher for F-95 delivery and liveness with a
separate notification path: relay-identity watcher → relay child → root.
The two distinct identities/cursors, wait, forwarding, liveness, and restart
disciplines live only in
[`use-monitor-for-event-driven-wake` § Codex NOTIFY](../rules/use-monitor-for-event-driven-wake.md#codex-notify-session-relay).
This mechanism reference supplies the three-leg acceptance model; it does not
duplicate that host procedure.

Falsifiability: re-test this requirement when Copilot CLI ships a
Monitor-equivalent primitive or forwards incremental detached-process output
as notices. Remove the scheduled check only after the directed-event acceptance
test passes. MCP-156 owns the durable Copilot lifecycle and notification-path
cure; this section records the interim operational contract.

## Identity discipline (load-bearing)

Self-exclusion uses the canonical PDR-076a routing-identity comparator
`sameAgentRoutingKey`, not a hand-rolled name, platform, model, or prefix
comparison. The current routing path is strict and ID-keyed: two sessions with
the same display name but different IDs remain distinct and can observe one
another's events, while historical id-less events never self-match a live
seat. Other documentation points to this interface rather than restating a
second routing tuple.

## Liveness (the heartbeat-source attribution pattern)

A watcher is a single-process intake mechanism. If the process
dies silently — host crash, panic in an event handler, container
OOM — nothing notices until a peer waits unreasonably long for a
reply. The remedy is **liveness attestation**: the watcher writes a
freshness signal to a substrate file on every tick.

The minimal liveness record:

```json
{
  "agent_id": { "...identity tuple..." },
  "last_alive_at": "2026-05-19T12:00:00.000Z",
  "source": "watcher"
}
```

The `source` field is a **free-form string**. The substrate does
not enumerate source values; the value is descriptive only.
"watcher", "check", "manual" are all valid. Readers compute
freshness as `now - last_alive_at` against a threshold; sources
help an observer distinguish redundant liveness writers (see
"Loop" below). A substrate that enumerates a closed `mode`
taxonomy of how heartbeats are produced taxes itself with
platform-capability knowledge that goes stale every time a host
adds a feature; the free-form `source` field is the
substrate-primitive equivalent.

### Anchored canonical implementation (this repo, 2026-05-23)

The canonical implementation of the liveness substrate in this
repo is `agent-tools/src/collaboration-state/watcher-heartbeat.ts`
(landed `SHA:db275c09`). It implements the same substrate
primitive described above but with a richer schema sized to the
operational needs of the in-tree `comms watch` CLI:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "0.2.0",
  "watched_comms_dir": "/absolute/coordination/home/.agent/state/collaboration/comms",
  "pid": 12345,
  "started_at": "2026-05-23T12:00:00.000Z",
  "last_drain_at": "2026-05-23T12:30:00.000Z",
  "last_emit_at": "2026-05-23T12:30:00.123Z",
  "last_error_at": null,
  "emitted_count": 42,
  "heartbeat_interval_ms": 30000,
  "watcher_identity": { "...identity tuple..." }
}
```

Structural deltas from the minimum-viable shape above:

- `agent_id` is renamed `watcher_identity` (same identity-tuple
  shape; the rename anchors the field to the watcher's role
  rather than a generic agent reference).
- The single `last_alive_at` is replaced by three per-action
  timestamps (`last_drain_at`, `last_emit_at`, `last_error_at`).
  The free-form producer-mode `source` field is absent: the structured
  tick-tracking names that mode implicitly (a recent `last_emit_at`
  means the emit path is alive; a recent `last_error_at` with no recent
  emit means the watcher is alive but unhealthy).
- `watched_comms_dir` records the lexically absolute directory the
  watcher actually drains. It is a path, not a source-mode enum. F-95
  readers compare it with the expected canonical comms directory, so
  relocating a heartbeat or cursor cannot make a watcher on a decoy
  stream attest canonical visibility.
- Schema versioning (`schema_version`), process identity (`pid`),
  start time (`started_at`), throughput accounting
  (`emitted_count`), and cadence declaration
  (`heartbeat_interval_ms`) are added as operational fields.

Cadence: N = 30 s default; stale-threshold = 3 × N = 90 s.
Consumers detect a stale watcher by file mtime (`Date.now() -
mtime > 3 × heartbeat_interval_ms`). The 3× ratio accommodates
GC pauses, brief filesystem latency, and polling jitter inside
the watch loop.

The canonical impl exposes `writeWatcherHeartbeat` (atomic write
of the heartbeat file) and `parseWatcherHeartbeat` (strict
reverse-parse; throws `TypeError` on schema mismatch). Consumers
must re-arm a watcher after the `0.1.0` → `0.2.0` source-binding
transition; the strict reader deliberately rejects the older shape
rather than treating an unbound heartbeat as proof. Consumers
that want to read heartbeats from arbitrary watcher impls should
adapt: the minimum-viable shape above remains valid for foreign
implementations, and the canonical shape is one phenotype of the
substrate primitive.

## Loop — the theoretical complement (under exploration)

Watch is event-driven, sub-second, and a single failure point. An
**independent liveness floor** can be added by composing watch
with a periodic check command driven by a host scheduler such as
Claude Code's `/loop`:

- Watch handles fast-path delivery (sub-second).
- A periodic `check` command runs every N seconds and writes a
  liveness record with `source: "check"`.

If watch dies, the check-driven heartbeat keeps the liveness
record fresh, and observers can tell which writer is alive by
inspecting `source` on the most recent record. On hosts without
an event-driven watch (no Monitor-equivalent), the polled `check`
becomes the sole liveness writer — honestly polled, not
"degraded".

The host-integration question to validate per agent host:

- **Claude Code**: does `/loop ~270s "<check-command>"` reliably
  drive the check at the requested cadence without disrupting the
  agent's reasoning context? Observe over a real session of 30+
  minutes; record outcome.
- **Codex / Cursor / other hosts**: does an equivalent scheduling
  primitive exist? If not, the polled-only mode on those hosts
  may need a different driver (a sidecar process, a shell
  `while sleep` loop, a cron entry).

This composition is **not enforced by the substrate**. The
substrate exposes the primitive (a liveness record with a
`source` field). Agents choose whether to run watch alone, check
alone, or both, based on the freshness requirement of their
responsibility and the capabilities of their host.

## Anti-patterns

- **Tiered reliability ranking**: presenting watch / check /
  manual-poll as a ranked fallback hierarchy bundles transport,
  platform capability, and freshness requirement onto one axis.
  They are independent. Document them as independent axes (mode,
  transport, freshness requirement); let agents compose.
- **Substrate-enforced source enum**: typing the `source` field
  as a closed enum (`'watcher' | 'check' | 'manual'`) re-imports
  the taxonomy the free-form string was meant to retire. Keep
  `source` as a free-form string at the type level; runtime
  values can be whatever the writer chooses.
- **Self-echoing watchers**: any fallback or ad-hoc watcher that invents its
  own identity comparison can diverge from routing truth and self-echo or
  suppress a distinct seat. Reuse the canonical `sameAgentRoutingKey`
  comparator.
- **Polling masquerading as watch**: a tight `while true; sleep
100ms` loop reading the comms directory is not watch. It is
  polling at 100ms. Document it as polling, name the cadence
  honestly, and prefer the event-driven watcher when the host
  supports it.
- **Delivery treated as notification**: a watcher that marks an event seen and
  writes it to the detached process's captured stdout has delivered the event
  to a process, not necessarily to the agent. Require a proven host wake-up
  path or apply the periodic comms check with its own absorption cursor.

## Minimum viable substrate

To support the watch mechanism described above, a host repo needs:

1. A comms directory holding append-only event files.
2. An event schema with at least `event_id`, `created_at`,
   `agent_id`, optional `addressee`, free-form `body`.
3. A per-session seen-events file path convention.
4. An identity-tuple shape sufficient to disambiguate concurrent
   sessions.
5. A liveness-record schema (free-form `source`).
6. A CLI surface that lets an agent invoke `watch` with the
   comms directory, the addressee tuple, the seen-events path,
   and (optionally) a heartbeat sink path.

Everything else — coordinator roles, claim/queue lifecycles,
reliability tiers — is composition over these primitives, not
substrate. Keep the substrate small.
