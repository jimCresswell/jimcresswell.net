# Testing Patterns

Reusable testing recipes referenced by the
[testing strategy](../../.agent/directives/testing-strategy.md) and
[ADR-078](../architecture/architectural-decisions/078-dependency-injection-for-testability.md).

`.agent/directives/testing-strategy.md` is the authoritative doctrine.
This file is a governed recipe companion; patterns here must conform to the
directive and to the immediate-fail rules.

## In-Process App Tests with Dependency Injection

Tests that create the application in-process (via `createApp()`)
must configure it through dependency injection with explicit runtime-config
objects or hermetic test helpers, never by reading or mutating `process.env`.
Do not import production config loaders unless the test is directly proving
the loader; they may read `.env` files as part of the production pipeline.
Supertest classification follows the boundary, not the tool — see
[Test File Classification](#test-file-classification).

### The Pattern

```typescript
import { createApp } from '../src/application.js';
import request from 'supertest';
import { createMockObservability, createMockRuntimeConfig } from './helpers/test-config.js';

// 1. Build an explicit runtime config — never read or mutate process.env
const runtimeConfig = createMockRuntimeConfig({
  dangerouslyDisableAuth: true,
  env: { EXAMPLE_API_KEY: 'test-api-key' },
});

// 2. Create the app with DI — zero global side effects
const app = await createApp({
  runtimeConfig,
  observability: createMockObservability(runtimeConfig),
});

// 3. Test with supertest — no external network IO
const response = await request(app).get('/healthz');
expect(response.status).toBe(200);
```

### Key Rules

- Do not read or write `process.env` in tests. Build literal runtime
  config objects or use hermetic test helpers that do not read disk.
- Do not import `loadRuntimeConfig` into these tests unless the runtime
  config loader is the direct unit under test.
- For tests needing multiple configurations (e.g. auth enabled
  vs disabled), create **separate config objects** for each case.
- Functions like `enableAuthBypass()` that mutate `process.env`
  must not exist. Use the isolated env pattern instead.

### Subprocess-Spawned Tests

Tests that spawn the application as a **separate process** (e.g.
smoke tests using `spawn('node', [entryPoint], { env })`) may pass
environment variables via the spawn `env` option. This is safe
because the variables are scoped to the child process and cannot
leak into the test runner.

Vitest smoke suites may load ambient environment in the runner config
composition root, validate it, and pass the resulting object through
`test.provide` / `inject`. Test files and setup files must consume the
injected object; they must not read or write `process.env`.

### Reference Implementations

## Untestable Code Is a Product-Code DI Defect

When adding tests to existing green code would make them audit-shaped, check
whether the untestability is itself the defect: a test that is merely
audit-shaped is deleted or rewritten (`tdd-as-design` §Describe vs. Audit),
while a seam testable only through prohibited mechanisms, or a test that seems
to need real IO, IS the defect. In both of those shapes the product code lacks
a dependency-injection seam (ADR-078):

- **A seam testable only through prohibited mechanisms** (ambient env import,
  a module-level singleton reachable only via `vi.mock`, a non-injectable
  route). The conformant cure is a **fresh TDD cycle** against a
  not-yet-existing injectable seam — genuine RED first — NOT a retrofit and
  NOT abstention (test-expert ruling, 2026-07-01, curriculum-hub search seam:
  extract the core with the service injected + a `createHandler(fn)` factory).
  "Tests would be audit-shaped" is a signal to inspect the product code's
  injectability, never merely a reason to skip.
- **A unit or integration test that seems to need real IO** beyond the
  loopback harness exchange with an imported app (see [Test File
  Classification](#test-file-classification)). The fix is to refactor the
  product to be testable (route the read/write through an injectable
  dependency, as sibling modules already do) and inject an in-memory fake —
  never to leave the IO in the test, and never to treat the refactor as
  out-of-scope ("if you need to refactor code to make it testable that is a
  good thing — that is surfacing an architectural issue and fixing it";
  owner, 2026-06-13).

## Real-Content Backstops for Transforms

For any generator, transform, extractor, or content firewall, **green
fixtures are not proof**: fixtures encode the cases you already thought
of, and the real source carries the ones you didn't. Add a backstop that
runs on the real source — a generation-time assertion or a real-content
test — and inspect the real output before calling the transform done
(worked instances 2026-06-30: fixtures passed twice while the real
generated body carried a routing coupling and a structure leak that only
grepping the real content caught). For a separation or firewall that
encodes a principle, the real-content check IS the proof.

## Test File Classification

Test classification is based on what the test actually does,
not what the author intends:

- **Module-level state = integration**: any test that touches
  module-level singletons with IO must be
  `*.integration.test.ts`, even if it injects DI fakes for
  the new behaviour.
- **Supertest classifies by boundary, not tool** (owner-ratified
  2026-07-29): `request(app)` against an imported, in-process app
  is an integration test — the harness's loopback socket is tool
  mechanics, not a system boundary. Supertest driven at a
  separately running black-box system over a network interface
  is E2E.
- **Middleware proofs mount the middleware alone**: mount the
  middleware on a bare `express()` app with one probe route and
  drive it with `request(app)`; never boot the full application to
  prove one middleware decision (review lens Q3/Q4). Worked
  example:
  `apps/oak-curriculum-mcp-streamable-http/src/correlation/middleware.integration.test.ts`.

## Composition Testing

Unit + E2E tests can all pass while the integrated product
fails. For features spanning multiple modules (MCP tool →
SDK → host), add a **composition test** that exercises the
integration seam.

Example: `mcp-app-composition.e2e.test.ts` caught
knip/depcruise cleanup that broke the UI — the composition
test IS the enforcement for multi-module integration.

## MCP Transport Layer Testing

Supertest tests JSON-RPC but not SSE transport
serialisation. For MCP servers, the transport layer IS part
of the product contract — `_meta` fields, session lifecycle,
and event streaming all happen there. Use MCP client SDK
(`Client` + `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`) for
full-fidelity E2E tests alongside supertest.

## Rendered-Output Assertions

Test a function that returns rendered or string output (a statusline
renderer, a formatter, a layout assembler) by **observable relationships
through the interface** — "the line containing X also contains Y",
relative order, presence/absence — never geometry or exact content.

- Forbid: pinned row indices (`rows[2]`), `toHaveLength` line counts,
  exact ANSI-escape literals, whole-object `.toEqual` on the parsed
  result. A harmless layout reflow or an added field must not break a
  test that proves nothing about behaviour.
- Strip ANSI before asserting visible text; prefer `toMatchObject` over
  `.toEqual` so additive fields don't break unrelated tests.
- Write helpers (line-containing-needle, relative-index, strip-ANSI) and
  assert relationships. Treat any `rows[N]` / line-count / exact-escape
  assertion on rendered output as a coupling smell to remove.

This is the rendered-output specialisation of testing-strategy's "test
behaviour through public interfaces; assert effects, not internal
constants". (Owner-corrected twice in one session, 2026-06-29.)

The same discipline covers **owner-tunable values** (a separator glyph, a
colour, a cosmetic label, a display string): a test that hard-codes one
asserts configuration, not behaviour, and breaks on every free owner
change. The cure is DI-for-testability (ADR-078): make the value a
parameter with a default, have the test **inject a probe value and assert
the probe renders** — default-independent — and keep the default as
editable config no test references. Verify by grepping the tests for the
default value: zero matches (worked instance 2026-06-15: a statusline
separator pinned literally across a suite broke on every glyph change;
the probe-injection cure ended the churn).

## Flaky-Test Disposition

Evaluate a flaky test before silencing it: is it a good test (describes a
system state per `tdd-as-design`)? A good-intent test with a fragile,
environment-coupled assertion gets its **assertion fixed to prove visible
behaviour** (e.g. strip ANSI and assert the visible text — a colour-support
split once made the same source green in a no-colour run and red in a colour
one); a genuinely bad test (proves types, mirrors implementation, tests the
mock) gets **deleted**. Never skip, retry-wrap, or loosen a flake — the
wrapper silences the signal without curing the coupling; the only
dispositions are fix-the-assertion or delete (see
[`testing-strategy`](../../.agent/directives/testing-strategy.md) §Rules).

## Acceptance Value-Proxies

Acceptance value-proxies must compare against independent ground-truth
measures. A value-proxy acceptance criterion ("the new CLI produces a
value within ±N% of the prior baseline") is **tautological** if the
new implementation and the baseline use the same method. Reproducing
the baseline value does not validate correctness; it validates only
internal consistency.

Worked example: a token-count CLI defines acceptance as "the chars/4
output agrees with the prior chars/4 baseline ±5%." The baseline is
itself chars/4. The CLI cannot fail the acceptance check by
construction — chars/4 reproducing chars/4 proves nothing.

The cure is to compare against a **method-independent ground-truth
measure**. For token-count, that is `wc -c` for total characters; the
chars/4 conversion then becomes a mechanical step verified
independently. For other domains, the ground-truth measure is the
authoritative external observation (file size from `stat`, byte count
from the filesystem, response time from a stopwatch, etc.) that the
proxy is supposed to approximate.

Acceptance criteria framed as "agrees with prior baseline ±N%" without
naming an independent ground-truth measure are tautological and fail
under normal churn (any drift looks like baseline error rather than
proxy error). Reject the framing at plan-author time, not at WS
execution.

## Testability Seams Must Not Bypass the Gate Under Test

A convenience seam added to make a guarded surface testable — a CLI
override flag, a mode env var, a directory redirect — can itself become a
bypass of the very gate or backstop the test exists to prove, or a leak
path for ambient disk state (`.env.local` via global `process.env`) into
tests. When adding a testability seam to a protective surface, review it
as product attack surface: can the seam disable the protection in
production invocations, and does the test still prove the gate fires with
the seam present? Inject configuration explicitly (DI) rather than adding
ambient overrides — see `no-global-state-in-tests`.

## Test Configuration Gotchas

- `tsconfig.json` `include` patterns `**/*.test.ts` and `**/*.spec.ts` do NOT match
  test utility files (harness, fixture builder). Add `tests/**/*.ts` to the include
  array when creating non-test utilities in test directories.
- ESLint `projectService: true` uses the nearest `tsconfig.json`, not
  `tsconfig.lint.json`. Files must be included in both for linting to work.
- Stale vitest include globs are silent because of `passWithNoTests: true` — remove
  dead globs promptly after file moves.
- `resolveEnv` integration tests that need `.env` file isolation: use `'/tmp'` as
  `startDir` to prevent ambient `.env` files from satisfying schema requirements.
- After refactoring entry points (removing `dotenv`, changing `loadRuntimeConfig`
  signature), check E2E tests that launch the process directly — they break when the
  entry-point contract changes.
- Removing a test (e.g. deleting an audit-shaped constant assertion) can orphan the
  export it referenced — knip then blocks the commit. Un-export or delete the orphan
  in the same change.
- A spread-derived object is a new object (the codegen helper `ensurePathsOnSchema`
  is one): assert structural equality with `toStrictEqual`, never identity with `toBe`.

## Discriminating Fixtures

Pick test inputs that maximally **distinguish** the contract from its plausible
regressions — a fixture that still passes under a wrong implementation is a weak
tripwire.

- **Place a witness value _between_ events, not after them.** For an as-of / `--now`
  filter over time-ordered fixtures (e.g. events at 11:00 and 12:00), a `--now` of
  `11:30` (between) fails loud if the filter couples wrongly and drops an event; a
  `--now` after all events (e.g. `13:00`) passes green even under a broken filter.
- The general rule: choose the input that, under the most likely wrong
  implementation, produces a _different_ observable result from the correct one.

## Test Isolation

- Replace Express `_router` access with supertest HTTP assertions.
- Extract repeated setup into scoped helpers inside `describe`.
- Bulk factories accept `startIndex`; do not mutate readonly `_id`.
