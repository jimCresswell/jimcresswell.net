# EDR-003: Ecosystem language removal

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-02-18

## Context

The word "ecosystem" appeared in the CV content, notably in Research P4: "a lens that now informs my emphasis on enabling ecosystems rather than building destinations." It had already been removed from the positioning paragraphs and capabilities in earlier editorial sessions.

Jim's assessment: "ecosystem" is not at all clear what it means. The intent behind the word — in every place it appeared — was about systems, context, and creating and holding the conditions for new states to emerge.

## Decision

Remove "ecosystem" language from all content. Replace with concrete descriptions of what is actually meant — typically one of:

- **Systems** — the actual systems being influenced or changed
- **Context** — the conditions surrounding a problem
- **Creating and holding conditions for new states to emerge** — the specific work Jim does

This is not a banned word — it is a clarity decision. If a future context arises where "ecosystem" is genuinely the clearest term, it can be reconsidered. But in every case so far, the replacement has been clearer.

## Consequences

- Research P4 still contains "enabling ecosystems rather than building destinations" — this needs replacing with concrete language about systems, context, and creating and holding conditions for new states to emerge.
- Any future content work should avoid "ecosystem" and use the specific concept it would stand for.
