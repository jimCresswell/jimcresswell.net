# Editorial Decision Records

This directory contains Editorial Decision Records (EDRs) for significant editorial decisions about Jim's content. EDRs are the editorial counterpart to [Architecture Decision Records](../../architecture/decision-records/) — they record what was decided, what was considered, and why, so future agents and humans can understand the editorial history.

## Format

Each EDR follows the same lightweight format as ADRs:

- **Status** — Accepted, Superseded, or Deprecated
- **Date** — When the decision was made
- **Context** — The problem or situation that prompted the decision
- **Decision** — What was decided and why
- **Consequences** — How this affects current and future content

## Relationship to editorial guidance

[editorial-guidance.md](../../../.agent/directives/editorial-guidance.md) holds **general principles** — voice, register, audience, editorial hierarchy. EDRs record **specific decisions** about how content is framed, with the context and alternatives that led to the decision. The editorial guidance governs; EDRs explain.
