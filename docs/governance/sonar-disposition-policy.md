# Sonar Disposition Policy

## Purpose

This document codifies how findings from the code-quality analyser and the
code-scanning analyser — security hotspots, security-class issues and
quality issues alike — are resolved, so that the same reasoning is not
re-derived per site by every reviewer. Since the owner's ruling of
2026-09-08 (§[One-Outcome Rule](#one-outcome-rule-owner-ruled-2026-09-08))
that resolution is a fix in the tree, with one named exception; the
documented classes below carry what each rule sees and which change clears
it, so a finding in a known class is cured by reference and only a site
outside every documented class needs fresh judgement.

The policy composes with the analysers' own records: a cured finding closes
on the next analysis of the corrected code, and the one excepted class
carries its per-site record there, explained by comments in the tree.
Together they give an auditable record: _what the pattern is_, _what
clears it_, and _which sites instantiate it_.

## Authority and Doctrine

- [`principles.md`][principles] §Strict and Complete and §Architectural
  Excellence Over Expediency.
- [`safety-and-security.md`][safety] — repository security baseline.
- [`never-disable-checks`][no-disable] — quality gates stay on; this policy
  does not weaken Sonar, it documents the substantive judgement Sonar's
  hotspot model defers to a human.

## One-Outcome Rule (owner-ruled 2026-09-08)

Owner ruling, 2026-09-08, verbatim: **"We don't dismiss issues, we fix
them."** Every finding from either analyser resolves to **one outcome**:
`FIXED` — a change in the tree after which the finding no longer fires,
closed by the next analysis. `FALSE_POSITIVE`, `SAFE`, `ACCEPTED` and
`ACKNOWLEDGED` are analyser-side states this policy does not grant: a
finding that is genuinely wrong about a site is still cured by a change
that stops it firing (a literal removed, a shape restructured, a value
sourced differently), never by an act in the analyser's console. Precedent
in the analyser (a site marked before the ruling) licenses nothing at the
next site.

**The one exception, owner-ruled the same day, verbatim:** "in regard to
the rate limiting work, we are going to pause that for now, and leave
comments in the code that recognise that additional in-process rate
limiting would provide defence in depth, but that we regard the two sets of
edge WAFs to be sufficient for safety for now. And in this ONE case we can
dismiss the findings in Sonar, and preferably find a way to keep them
dismissed instead of revisiting this same issue every few weeks." The class
is **missing rate limiting on the MCP server's route handlers** and nothing
else: ADR-219 (rate limiting at the edge, no in-process limiter) stands
unchanged; BEFORE any dismissal, each route the analyser names carries a
comment in the tree recognising that additional in-process rate limiting
would provide defence in depth and naming the edge controls relied on; then
each finding takes one dismissal in the analyser's own record, once,
explained by that comment and citing the ADR — never a path exclusion, a
query filter or a rule-ignore, which would silence the rule beyond those
sites. At this amendment's date the route comments (`auth-routes.ts`,
`oauth-proxy-routes.ts`, `bootstrap-helpers.ts`) name the edge control and
cite ADR-219 but do not yet recognise the defence-in-depth option, so the
four dismissals wait on that comment change landing in the tree. Automatic analysis reads no file-based rule ignore
(§[File-Based Configuration](#file-based-configuration-sonarcloudproperties)),
so the record is per site, and the comment is what keeps it from being
re-litigated.

## Disposition Workflow

1. **Is the site the excepted class?** If the finding is missing rate
   limiting on one of the MCP server's route handlers, apply the exception
   as the One-Outcome Rule states — the comment at the route first, then one
   dismissal in the analyser's record citing ADR-219, recorded once — and
   stop. This
   is the only step with a server-side action, and it is not a class in the
   catalogue below.
2. Otherwise **match the rule key** to a documented class below.
3. **Match the site shape** against the class's shape criteria; they say
   what the analyser is seeing, which is what tells you the cure.
4. Apply the class's **cure**: make the change and let the next analysis
   close the finding. There is no server-side action here; a `FIXED` state
   is assigned by analysis, never by hand.
5. If the rule is documented but the site shape does not match: do per-site
   review, cure it, and consider whether the class needs a sub-clause
   amendment recording the new shape and its cure.
6. If the rule is not yet documented: cure the site and add the class to
   this document at the next consolidation pass.

## General Disposition Principles

These govern _how_ a finding is dispositioned, beneath the per-class catalogue:

- **Precedent is not correctness.** N prior dismissals of a rule do not make
  _this_ site a false-positive — verify the defect's presence or absence
  first-hand at each site. (A 12×-dismissed `incomplete-sanitization` rule still
  flagged a real backslash-escaping bug; the fix was genuine.)
- **A lens-resolvable cure is not an owner decision.** When the
  [decision lenses][principles] (LTAE first) decisively resolve which change
  cures a site, decide it — framing a lens-resolved call as an owner-fork is
  analysis-passback. Escalate only when all lenses genuinely fail or the
  scope is product/feature. (The one analyser-side act this policy still
  admits, the excepted class's dismissal, is the owner's; the cure
  _determination_ never is.)
- **A deliberately-adopted profile's findings are a worklist, not noise.** When
  the owner activates an analyser profile on purpose, the target is zero,
  by cure. Do NOT frame the resulting backlog as an activation-wave
  to "wait out" via push-and-reanalyse — that lesson is for STALE / zombie
  analysis against a moving target, never a fresh deliberate profile.
- **The posture is fix-first with zero dismissals, for both analysers.**
  It began as the CodeQL posture (owner reversal, 2026-07-29 — _"why should
  I dismiss issues detected by CodeQL?"_) and became the rule for every
  finding on 2026-09-08. Dismissals are per-instance and do not survive
  refactors (alerts #83–86 recurred as #226–229 after the code moved), so a
  dismissal buys silence, not absence: cure structurally in the code
  instead. The posture was vindicated when a flagged pattern proved to be a
  real super-linear-backtracking ReDoS vector. Agents never dismiss alerts
  on their own PRs; the one dismissal the One-Outcome Rule excepts is the
  owner's act.
- **Triage by cause-class, but a class splits by disposition-route.** A rule
  class (e.g. a regex backlog) does not resolve uniformly: generated output →
  fix at the generator; generator source → fix in place + regen; hand-written →
  consolidate to the rule's home; vendored/standard → refactor-to-import;
  runtime-only → fix in place. An owner's "do X to all of them" applies cleanly
  only to the class it actually fits.

## Cure Constraints (class-level, from the fix-forward arcs)

- **S2871 (provide a compare function)**: never cure with `localeCompare` —
  locale-dependent ordering breaks reproducible snapshot ordering (16 sites
  in the founding arc). Use a code-unit comparator.

## Remediation Branch Source of Truth

When a branch is opened to remediate existing main/project Sonar debt, the
authoritative backlog is the current main/project issue and hotspot inventory.
PR-scoped Sonar for that remediation branch is a regression guard: use it to
prove the branch has not introduced new findings, not to redefine the original
worklist. Branch findings that predate the remediation branch's changes must be
reconciled against the main/project source before they become implementation
work.

## Documented Classes

Each class below records what the analyser sees, the shape criteria that
identify the class at a site, and the cure. The criteria were written, before
the 2026-09-08 ruling, as the conditions under which a site could be marked
`SAFE` or `FALSE_POSITIVE` in the analyser, and the canonical rationales
were the comments those marks carried; under the
[One-Outcome Rule](#one-outcome-rule-owner-ruled-2026-09-08) they identify
the class and license no mark. Every class below records its **cure** —
the change that makes the pattern absent at a site that meets the
criteria, alongside the FIX path its failing sites always took — so this
policy is complete on its own, and any plan that applies these cures to
sites references this policy, never the reverse. Sites marked before the
ruling keep their record; the ruling binds every finding
from its date, and any re-disposition of the earlier marks is the owner's
call (§[Maintenance](#maintenance)).

### S5443 — Publicly writable directories

**Pattern**: `/tmp` (or other publicly-writable paths) appears as a path
argument in test code.

**Identification** — the class is present at a site when all hold (before
the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a `SAFE` mark; they
license none now):

- Site is in a file matching `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.unit.test.ts`,
  `**/*.integration.test.ts`, `**/*.e2e.test.ts`, or `e2e-tests/**` /
  `tests/**` directories.
- The path is either passed to a mocked filesystem (vi.fn() spies) or used
  inside a test runner's transient sandbox.
- No production runtime code path resolves to the same site.

**Canonical rationale**: "test-fixture path; mocked or transient-sandbox
filesystem use; no production runtime exposure".

**Worked example**: `packages/libs/logger/src/file-sink.unit.test.ts:43` —
`tmp/test.log` passed alongside vi.fn() mocked `fs`. No real filesystem
touch.

**Cure** (every site): a per-run directory from `fs.mkdtemp` under
`os.tmpdir()` — or the test runner's own temporary directory — in place of
a fixed publicly writable path literal; a mocked filesystem takes a
non-public fixture path. The rule fires on the literal, and the literal is
never needed.

### S5332 — Clear-text protocols (`http://`)

**Pattern**: `http://` URL in code, typically `http://localhost:<port>`,
`http://fake-<service>:<port>`, `http://example.com`, or RFC-2606 reserved
test domains.

**Identification** — the class is present at a site when all hold (before
the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a `SAFE` mark; they
license none now):

- Site is in a test file (same glob set as S5443) or in a test-runner
  config (`playwright.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, etc.) or a
  `test-helpers/`, `e2e-fakes/` module.
- The URL targets a synthetic test endpoint, a localhost loopback, or an
  RFC-reserved test domain — never a production hostname.
- Production deployments use `https://` URLs sourced from environment
  variables; this URL is not the production-runtime value.

**Canonical rationale**: "test-fixture URL; synthetic/localhost/test-domain
target; production runtime uses `https://` env var".

**Cure** (every site): `https://` for every URL that names a real host; a
test that needs a clear-text loopback endpoint builds the URL at runtime
from the runner-assigned address and a scheme constant instead of carrying
an `http://` literal in source (the worked example under the 2026-09-08
amendment is this class's).

### S1313 — Hardcoded IP addresses

**Pattern**: IP literal (RFC 1918 private, RFC 3849 documentation,
loopback, or synthetic) in code.

**Identification** — the class is present at a site when all hold (before
the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a `SAFE` mark; they
license none now):

- Site is in a test file (same glob set as S5443).
- The IP is a fixture value driving a test of header-redaction,
  rate-limiting, IP-parsing, or similar input-handling code.
- The IP is not embedded in production code as a runtime configuration
  default.

**Canonical rationale**: "test-fixture IP literal; drives input-handling
test; not a production-runtime value".

**Cure** (every site): a named host or a configuration value in place of
the literal; a test of address-handling code builds its input at runtime
(from octets, or from the parsed form the code under test consumes) so no
address literal sits in source.

### S5852 — Slow regular expressions

**Pattern**: Regex with super-linear complexity flagged by Sonar's regex
analyser.

**Identification** — the class is present at a site when all hold (before
the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a `SAFE` mark; they
license none now):

- Site runs at codegen time (`pnpm sdk-codegen`), build time
  (`pnpm build`), or in a data-pipeline / admin CLI —
  never inside a request handler.
- Input is upstream-controlled: OpenAPI schema, generated TypeScript
  source, sitemap XML from allowlisted hosts (`isAllowedSitemapUrl` or
  equivalent), curriculum bulk data, or repo-internal markdown.
- Pattern is anchored or character-class-bounded such that the
  super-linear behaviour cannot be triggered by the actual input shape.

**Canonical rationale**: "build-time/codegen-time regex; upstream-
controlled input; anchored or character-class-bounded; not a request-
handler path".

**FIX path and cure** (every site, request-handler or not): rewrite to
linear constructs (negated character classes, anchored alternations,
bounded quantifiers) or plain string operations, per the rule's documented
strategies; on a request-handler path the rewrite is urgent.

### S4036 — OS commands resolved via PATH (FIX-only — no SAFE disposition)

**Pattern**: `spawnSync`, `spawn`, `exec`, `execSync`, `execFileSync` etc.
resolving a command name (`pnpm`, `git`, `typedoc`) via PATH rather than
absolute path.

**Disposition**: there is none — S4036 is always **FIXED**, never disposed
`SAFE`. Execute the binary by a fixed absolute path so a user-writable `PATH`
entry cannot shadow it (the security property is the fixed absolute path, not
any guarantee the location is non-writable). For `git`, the canonical fix is
`resolveTrustedGit()` in `agent-tools/src/core/trusted-git.ts` (an absolute path
from a fixed, platform-partitioned allowlist of complete binary paths, resolved
without consulting `PATH` — partitioned because a rooted POSIX path is
drive-relative on win32 and a `C:\...` literal is a legal relative filename on
POSIX, so each platform may only ever probe its own family); other binaries
follow the same absolute-path shape.

**Why no SAFE class**: PATH-pinning (overriding `env.PATH` to trusted
directories) does **not** clear S4036 — the analyser flags the by-name call
regardless — so a SAFE disposition would document a non-fix as acceptable. The
genuine fix is cheap and available, so per `never-disable-checks` and the
One-Outcome Rule above, S4036 resolves to FIXED. A prior allowance for this
class is reviewed and migrated, never extended.

Where a platform offers no admin-protected install location for a binary, the
compliant outcome is a loud refusal on that platform, never an allowlist entry
in user-writable space. The worked instance is
`agent-tools/src/refounding/refound-gitleaks.ts`, which refuses on win32
because every gitleaks install location there is user-writable.

### S2245 — Pseudorandom number generator (`Math.random()`)

**Pattern**: `Math.random()` used in code.

**Identification** — the class is present when the use is one of the
following (before the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a
`SAFE` mark; they license none now):

- **Non-security identifier generation** combined with a uniqueness
  primitive (timestamp, monotonic counter): correlation IDs, request
  trace IDs, log-line nonces.
- **Retry-backoff jitter** (AWS-style full jitter or equivalent) used to
  spread retry timing.
- **Sampling / probabilistic dispatch** for non-security purposes (e.g.,
  metric sampling).

In all cases the output of `Math.random()` MUST NOT influence
authentication, authorisation, session binding, token generation, CSRF
state, or any cryptographic property.

**Canonical rationale (per use shape)**:

- Identifier: "non-security correlation/tracing identifier; combined with
  monotonic timestamp; no cryptographic property required".
- Backoff: "AWS-style full-jitter retry backoff; spreads retry timing
  against thundering-herd; not a security context".

**FIX path and cure** (every site): `crypto.randomUUID()`,
`crypto.randomInt()`, `crypto.randomBytes()` or `crypto.getRandomValues()`
in place of `Math.random()` — for identifiers, jitter and sampling as much
as for any cryptographic, session or token use; the cryptographic source
costs nothing at those sites and the rule stops firing.

### S1523 — Dynamic code execution (`eval`, `Function`, `javascript:`)

**Pattern**: `eval()`, `new Function(...)`, or `javascript:` URL.

**Identification** — the class is present at a site when all hold (before
the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a `SAFE` mark; they
license none now):

- Site is in test code AND the input to `Function` / `eval` is a string
  literal or a value derived synchronously from a same-file string literal
  (matching the rule's documented exception).
- The use is a syntax-validation tool, not a runtime evaluation of
  attacker-influenced input.

**Canonical rationale**: "test-only `Function`/`eval` as syntax validator
over same-file literal-derived input; no untrusted source; not in any
production code path".

**FIX path and cure** (every site): replace with a parser, a switch,
schema-driven dispatch, or a static lookup; a test that validates syntax
parses with the TypeScript compiler API or a parser package instead of
`Function`/`eval`. A production use with runtime-composed input is a real
defect and takes the same replacement.

### S4790 — Weak hash algorithm (MD5, SHA-1)

**Pattern**: `createHash('md5')`, `createHash('sha1')`, or equivalent.

**Identification** — the class is present at a site when all hold (before
the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a `SAFE` mark; they
license none now):

- Hash output is used purely for **format conversion** or **cache key
  derivation** from a non-secret input — never for integrity verification,
  authentication, signing, password hashing, or any security boundary.
- The choice is justified by a non-security property (specific
  byte-length output, deterministic short identifier, compatibility
  with an external schema like OpenTelemetry TraceId's 32-char hex).

**Canonical rationale**: "MD5 used as deterministic 128-bit format
conversion to derive [target schema] from non-secret input; not used in
integrity/authentication/signing context".

**FIX path and cure** (every site): SHA-256 (truncated to the required
length where a fixed-width identifier or an external schema's width is the
property wanted) for format conversion and cache keys; SHA-256 / SHA-512 /
HMAC / bcrypt / argon2 as appropriate for any security use.

### S5689 — Framework version disclosure

**Pattern**: Express (or similar framework) instantiation that, by
default, emits a framework-identifying response header (`X-Powered-By`,
`Server`, etc.).

**Identification** — the class is present when **a runtime test asserts
the header is absent** at the application layer (before the 2026-09-08
ruling this was the condition for a `SAFE` mark; it licenses none now). Static analysis cannot see
downstream middleware (e.g., helmet's `hidePoweredBy`); the test pins the
property regardless of implementation detail.

**Canonical rationale**: "framework-version header verified absent at
runtime by `<test path:line>`; downstream middleware (helmet
`hidePoweredBy` or equivalent) strips the header globally; test acts as
regression guard".

**FIX path and cure** (every site, including one whose runtime test
already passes): add `app.disable('x-powered-by')` (Express) or helmet's
`hidePoweredBy` AT THE INSTANTIATION SITE ITSELF, where static analysis
can see it — downstream middleware in another module leaves the site
firing — AND keep the test that asserts the header's absence. The test is
mandatory; the disable call alone is insufficient because future config
changes can silently re-enable the disclosure.

### S6505 — Dependency installation lifecycle scripts

**Pattern**: a dependency-install command (`pnpm install`, `npm install`,
`yarn install`) without an explicit `--ignore-scripts`, flagged because
dependency lifecycle scripts can execute arbitrary code at install time.

**Identification** — the class is present at a site when all hold (before
the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a `FALSE_POSITIVE`
mark; they license none now):

- The installer is **pnpm at major version ≥ 10** — pnpm 10 removed
  automatic execution of dependency lifecycle scripts
  ([pnpm 10 release notes](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.0.0)).
  Scripts run only for packages named in an explicit allowlist:
  `onlyBuiltDependencies` (pnpm 10) or its pnpm 11 replacement, the
  `allowBuilds` map in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  ([pnpm settings: `allowBuilds`](https://pnpm.io/settings#allowbuilds)).
- The repo pins that pnpm version authoritatively: root `package.json`
  `packageManager` field (currently `pnpm@11.8.0`) drives every CI site
  via `pnpm/action-setup` as an **exact version pin**. The field also
  carries a `+sha512` integrity suffix, but the pinned action strips it
  before `pnpm self-update` (`readTargetVersion`'s split on `+`), so CI
  enforces the version, not the content hash — and the version alone is
  what this class's script-execution property attaches to.
- No global script re-enable is in force: `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds`
  is absent (or explicitly `false`) in every tracked pnpm config surface
  (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, any `.npmrc`) and is not passed on the flagged
  CI invocation — the setting bypasses the allowlist wholesale, so its
  absence is a criterion, not an assumption (verified absent in this
  repo's tracked config, 2026-07-20).
- Every allowlist entry is a **reviewed, build-requiring package** (the
  current six: `@clerk/shared`, `@sentry/cli`, `esbuild`,
  `unrs-resolver`, `core-js`, `sharp` — see
  [`build-system.md`](../engineering/build-system.md) §allowBuilds). The
  allowlist is tracked config: no arbitrary or newly added dependency
  can execute install scripts without a reviewed change to it. This is
  the rule's own compliant control for pnpm — the finding flags
  _unrestricted_ script execution, which the allowlist precludes.

**Canonical rationale**: "pnpm `<version>` pinned via `packageManager`;
pnpm ≥ 10 executes dependency lifecycle scripts only for the reviewed
`allowBuilds` allowlist (six build-requiring packages, tracked in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`); arbitrary dependencies cannot execute install
scripts at the flagged site".

**FIX path and cure** — for a pnpm ≥ 10 site the finding describes a
shape that cannot exhibit the defect, and the analyser-clearing change is
the flag it reads plus pnpm's documented complement: `pnpm install
--frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts` followed by `pnpm rebuild --pending`
(which builds the packages that were not built during an `--ignore-scripts`
install — `pnpm rebuild --help`, pnpm 11.20.0 — and the reviewed allowlist
still governs which of them execute scripts). Never a mark. For all
non-pnpm installers, and any pnpm < 10, the flag is installer-specific: `--ignore-scripts` for npm and Yarn Classic (1.x);
`--mode=skip-build` for Yarn Berry (2–4, whose `install` rejects
`--ignore-scripts`); `--ignore-scripts` for pnpm < 10. npm and yarn
execute dependency lifecycle scripts by default at every major version,
so no version argument substitutes for the flag there.

### S6506 — Unpinned transport on downloaded artefacts

**Pattern**: `curl` fetching an artefact without constraining the
protocol, so a redirect chain could downgrade to plain HTTP. (A `wget`
site also matches the rule but has no equivalent compliant flag —
`--https-only` governs recursive links, not redirect targets — so a
flagged `wget` fetch is replaced with the curl form below, or run with
redirects disabled.)

**Decision criteria**: there is no FALSE_POSITIVE disposition for
production or CI fetch sites — resolve as **FIXED** by pinning the
transport:
`--proto '=https' --proto-redir '=https'` (curl —
[`--proto`](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--proto) /
[`--proto-redir`](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--proto-redir)),
keeping any existing content pin (SHA-256 check) in place. The wget
`--https-only` semantics above are per the
[GNU Wget manual §HTTPS Options](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html). The content pin alone does not
clear the finding: integrity checking and transport pinning guard
different failure modes (tampered bytes vs downgrade interception), and
the analyser flags the transport.

**Canonical rationale** (for the FIXED trail): "transport pinned to HTTPS
including redirects; SHA-256 content pin retained".

### Generated Code

**Pattern**: Style-class issues (naming, formatting, structural smells,
duplication-shaped findings) raised on files produced by a code generator
under a path matching `**/src/types/generated/**` — primarily output of
`openapi-typescript` consumed by `packages/sdks/oak-sdk-codegen/` and
downstream MCP tool/stub generators.

**Identification** — the class is present at a site when all hold (before
the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a `FALSE_POSITIVE`
mark; they license none now):

- Site is in a path matching `**/src/types/generated/**`.
- The file is overwritten on `pnpm sdk-codegen` (or equivalent) from an
  upstream schema; no human edits the file directly.
- The finding is a style-class issue describing the generator's chosen
  output shape, not a security or correctness defect that would survive
  re-generation.

**Canonical rationale**: "generated by `openapi-typescript` under
`packages/sdks/oak-sdk-codegen/src/types/generated/**`; file is
overwritten on each codegen run; finding describes generator output shape
rather than a hand-maintained code defect; fix path is upstream in the
generator or the OpenAPI schema, not at this site".

**Worked example**: A type-alias usage shape (rule S4323) raised against a
file under `packages/sdks/oak-sdk-codegen/src/types/generated/api-schema/`
is identified under this class. The flagged shape is mechanically chosen
by `openapi-typescript`; the human-edited corpus does not exhibit it, and
the file is regenerated on each `pnpm sdk-codegen` run.

**FIX path**: the cure is in the codegen pipeline, never at the site and
never a mark — adjust the OpenAPI schema, update the generator, or
post-process the output so the flagged shape is no longer emitted; a
generator-output finding that represents a real defect (security,
correctness, runtime hazard) takes the same upstream route. Never hand-edit
a generated file.

## Duplications (cpd.exclusions)

Sonar's copy-paste detector (cpd) measures duplication as a
maintainability smell on the **maintainable code corpus**. The classes
below are excluded from that corpus because the structural repetition is
either inherent to the artefact (generator output) or intentional (test
isolation, package-local config shape) — duplication there is not signal.

This is a denominator-scope decision, not a rule disablement.
Hand-written library, application, and service code remains fully in
scope; duplication there continues to be reported and is treated as
signal under the standard quality gate.

### Excluded globs and per-glob architectural reason

- `**/src/types/generated/**` — output of `openapi-typescript` and
  downstream codegen. Generators emit large blocks of structurally
  identical TypeScript by design (e.g. one parameter-typing variant per
  operation, one tool stub per endpoint). The repetition is the
  generator's chosen shape; the durable fix path is upstream in the
  schema or generator, not at the site.

- `packages/sdks/oak-sdk-codegen/src/types/generated/api-schema/**` —
  owner-authorised audit-trail exception recorded on 2026-05-24. This path is
  already covered by `**/src/types/generated/**`; the narrower glob is retained
  because the owner explicitly authorised this generated-code boundary as a
  specific exception and the config should preserve that decision visibly.

- `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.test.tsx`, `**/tests/**`, `**/e2e-tests/**` —
  test isolation requires that each test arranges its own fixtures and
  collaborators without coupling to a sibling test's setup. DRYing across
  tests to satisfy cpd would force shared mutable setup and obscure the
  arrange/act/assert intent of individual cases. Repetition here is an
  affordance of the testing style, not a quality smell.

- `**/*.config.*` — package-local config files intentionally repeat the
  shape of the project boundary: imports from shared standards helpers,
  local `tsconfigRootDir` / resolver setup, and package-specific rule
  deltas. Real shared behaviour belongs in imported config helpers; the
  remaining repeated file shape is a readability and ownership boundary,
  not a maintainability smell.

- `**/*.external-data.ts` — external-source data snapshots (the
  external-data file convention). A file matching this suffix is a faithful
  mirror of an external dataset (e.g. the EEF Teaching & Learning Toolkit
  snapshot), not authored code. De-duplicating its data literals would
  distort fidelity to the external source — precisely the value the snapshot
  exists to preserve — so the durable fix path is upstream (the source or the
  refresh script), never at the site. The discriminator is _external-ness, not
  size_: a small external snapshot qualifies; a large hand-built lookup table
  does not. The convention carries a contract — a `*.external-data.ts`
  file MUST be pure data: it MUST carry a provenance docstring and MUST NOT
  export logic (function / class / enum), so the suffix cannot be used to
  dodge the duplication gate. Its types are derived from the data held `as
const` (the generalised compile-time discipline of ADR-038), never typed
  `unknown`. The contract is kept by review when the snapshot changes — the
  right tool for keeping one external-data file logic-free is to read it —
  not by an automated gate.
  The same suffix also drives the workspace ESLint code-quality ignore for the
  same architectural reason. Owner-authorised 2026-05-29.

- `agent-tools/src/core/agent-identity/schemas/**` — curated naming-schema
  wordlist data (ADR-198). Each registered era's themed word columns live in
  one pure-data module per theme; cpd's token-sequence matching normalises
  string-literal values, so six structurally identical data modules register
  as ~96 duplicated lines each while their actual content is provably
  disjoint — the curation gate tests enforce zero shared words across themes
  per column, a strictly stronger anti-duplication property than cpd
  measures. The material is digest-pinned and frozen at activation, so
  "de-duplicating" (merging the files) would damage the per-theme curation
  and review boundary to appease a false signal. The modules MUST stay pure
  data (word arrays plus one typed export each, no logic), kept by the
  curation gates and review. Owner-authorised 2026-06-11 (PR #189).

### What this does NOT do

- It does **not** silence duplication on real source files. Findings in
  hand-written library, app, or service code remain signal under the
  standard quality gate (current threshold: 3.0% duplication density on
  new code).
- It does **not** disable any Sonar rule. cpd.exclusions narrow only the
  duplication-analyser denominator; all other rule analysers continue to
  see the excluded files.
- It does **not** authorise removing real source files from the
  duplication corpus to clear a gate. Source-file duplication is cured by
  refactor, not by exclusion.

### Expansion discipline

Adding a new glob to `sonar.cpd.exclusions` requires, in order: policy
amendment first (with the per-glob architectural reason), owner
authorisation, then the `.sonarcloud.properties` update. The architectural
reason must be substantive — "the gate is failing" is not a reason. See
[§File-Based Configuration](#file-based-configuration-sonarcloudproperties).

## Issue Classes

Issue-class policies are added as they are codified. The same shape
applies: per-rule shape criteria, the rationale the class once carried, and
the FIX path. The outcome is `FIXED` via code change. A zombie finding
against stale main-branch analysis where the code has already been fixed is
cured by pushing so the analyser re-analyses; a rule that mis-fires on a
shape that cannot exhibit the defect it describes is cured by changing the
shape so the rule no longer fires, never by marking the finding.

### S8786 — Super-linear regular expressions

**Pattern**: Regex flagged by Sonar's runtime-complexity analyser as having
super-linear (potentially catastrophic) backtracking. The Issue-form sibling
of the [§S5852](#s5852--slow-regular-expressions) security hotspot: same
underlying concern (a regex whose worst case is super-linear in input length),
surfaced as a maintainability issue rather than a security hotspot.

**Identification** — the class is present at a site when all hold (before
the 2026-09-08 ruling these were the conditions for a `FALSE_POSITIVE`
mark; they license none now):

- Site runs at lint/validation time, codegen time, build time, or in a
  data-pipeline / admin CLI — never inside a request handler.
- Input is repo-internal or upstream-controlled: repo markdown, generated
  TypeScript, the OpenAPI schema, curriculum bulk data, or equivalent —
  never end-user request input.
- The pattern is anchored or character-class-bounded such that the
  super-linear behaviour the rule describes cannot be triggered by any
  input shape (for example, an end-anchored match over a negated character
  class, where the negated class and the following literal cannot overlap).

Whether or not the criteria hold, the outcome is the rewrite below; when
the regex is on a request-handler path the rewrite is urgent, not optional.

**Canonical rationale**: "validation/build-time regex; repo-internal input;
end-anchored over a negated character class so the flagged super-linear
backtracking cannot occur; not a request-handler path".

**FIX path**: rewrite the flagged regex
to linear constructs (negated character classes, anchored alternations,
bounded quantifiers) or to plain string operations, per the rule's
documented strategies.

**Worked examples** (all in agent-tooling validators, repo-internal markdown
input, end-anchored over negated classes — identified under this class and
marked before the ruling; since 2026-09-08 such a site is rewritten to the
linear form so the rule stops firing):

- `agent-tools/src/validators/markdown-links/validate-markdown-links-helpers.ts`
  — `/\s+"[^"]*"$/` strips a trailing markdown link title.
- `agent-tools/src/validators/reference-direction/validate-reference-direction-helpers.ts`
  — the same `/\s+"[^"]*"$/` title-strip.
- `agent-tools/src/practice-fitness/item-count.ts` — `/[^\w-]+$/` strips a
  trailing status annotation.

**Delta from prior**: this is the first Issue class codified beyond the
placeholder. It mirrors the established §S5852 hotspot class one-for-one in
decision shape (build/validation-time + controlled input + anchored/bounded
⇒ the class; request-handler ⇒ urgent), differing only in finding type
(Issue vs hotspot); under the One-Outcome Rule neither finding type takes a
mark. It does not relax any standard: a request-handler regex still fails
the gate.

## File-Based Configuration (`.sonarcloud.properties`)

This repo uses SonarCloud **automatic analysis**, which reads **only**
[`.sonarcloud.properties`][sonar-config]. There is deliberately no
`sonar-project.properties` — that file is read solely by the sonar-scanner CLI
(CI-based analysis), which this repo does not run, so it had no effect and was
removed once confirmed dead.

The only file-based analysis config is:

- `sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8` — pins source decoding so the analyser cannot fall
  back to a host JVM encoding and misdecode the repo's UTF-8.
- `sonar.cpd.exclusions` — the duplication-analyser denominator scope documented
  in [§Duplications](#duplications-cpdexclusions) above. It narrows only the cpd
  denominator; it disables no rule.

**There is no file-based rule-ignore mechanism, by design.**
`sonar.issue.ignore.multicriteria` (per-rule × glob disables) is a
sonar-scanner-CLI feature that automatic analysis does not read, _and_ a
forbidden anti-pattern under [`never-disable-checks`][no-disable] regardless: it
suppresses a rule across every current and future matching file, blind to
per-site context. A dead copy of such a block once lived in the unread
`sonar-project.properties` and never took effect; it has been removed.

**Every finding is therefore resolved in the tree**, per
[§Disposition Workflow](#disposition-workflow): the class definitions above
say what the analyser sees and which change clears it, and the next analysis
closes the finding. The absence of a file-based ignore is not a gap to be
filled by a server-side mark — since the 2026-09-08 ruling there is no mark
to make, for S5443 / S5332 / S1313 in test fixtures as for every other
class. The one per-site record the policy admits, the excepted rate-limiting
class, lives in the analyser's own record exactly because no file can carry
it without silencing the rule beyond its sites.

### Expansion discipline (`.sonarcloud.properties`)

The one file-based knob that carries policy is `sonar.cpd.exclusions`. Adding a
glob requires, in order: (1) policy amendment in this file with the per-glob
architectural reason; (2) owner authorisation — an agent may propose but must not
enact; (3) the `.sonarcloud.properties` update. The reason must be substantive —
"the gate is failing" is not a reason. Narrowing the duplication denominator for a
path range is functionally a gate-scope change, so it goes through the same
discipline as any [`never-disable-checks`][no-disable]-adjacent decision.

[sonar-config]: ../../.sonarcloud.properties

## Maintenance

- Amend this policy when a new pattern emerges, when a class needs a
  sub-clause for a new use shape, or when a previously-permitted shape
  is reclassified.
- Amendments must include a worked example and a clear delta-from-prior
  rationale. Removing a permitted shape requires re-disposition of any
  sites previously SAFE-d under the removed shape. The 2026-09-08 ruling
  removed every permitted mark at once; whether the sites marked before it
  are re-opened and cured, and in what order, is the owner's decision,
  recorded on whatever plan carries it when given — this policy binds
  forward from the ruling and does not re-open them by itself.
- The policy is a living document. Reviewers should challenge stale
  rationales at consolidation time.

## 2026-07-19 amendment: the studio-source scope (ADR-213), owner-ruled

Owner ruling (2026-07-19, verbatim): "Product code gets no sonar exclusions
for any reason (including generated product code), no quality gate
exceptions, nothing, it all gets the full set of strict, strict
requirements" — and scope exclusion is legitimate "if and only if they are
not used as production code, and are organised and moved and kept explicitly
as source material from Claude Design."

Implementation:

- **The boundary is structural, not a glob list**:
  `packages/design/oak-design-system/studio-source/` holds exactly the
  non-production Claude Design source material (specimens, white-label
  proofs, reference build, templates, compiled reference components,
  vendored reveal.js, proof pages — see its README). `sonar.exclusions` and
  the design-system `sonar.cpd.exclusions` glob bind that path alone.
- **Everything consumable is fully analysed** — the root token CSS, class
  library, print layer, `brand.css` (it is on the package export surface, so
  it is product code and back in scope), `oak-icons.css`, `oak-theme.js`,
  `dtcg/`, `assets/`, docs — under the standard gate including the
  duplication metric. Their findings resolve per-site in the tree (at this
  amendment's date `brand.css`'s commented-template findings were per-site
  FALSE_POSITIVE adjudications; since 2026-09-08 such a site is changed so
  the finding no longer fires), never a scope carve-out.
- **Movement rule**: if any studio-source file becomes consumed by product
  code, it moves out of `studio-source/` and under the full gate in the same
  change. Expansion of the studio-source scope follows the §Duplications
  discipline: policy amendment first, owner authorisation, then config.

## 2026-09-08 amendment: one outcome, one exception, owner-ruled

Owner ruling (2026-09-08, verbatim): "We don't dismiss issues, we fix
them." Given on the code-scanning lane's two owner-reserved acts as then
planned — `SAFE` marks for localhost literals in test helpers, and four
false-positive dismissals of missing-rate-limiting alerts citing ADR-219 —
and binding on every finding from either analyser from that date.

The same day, the one exception (verbatim in
§[One-Outcome Rule](#one-outcome-rule-owner-ruled-2026-09-08)): the
rate-limiting work is paused; the routes carry comments recognising the
defence-in-depth option and the edge controls relied on; and in this ONE
case the findings are dismissed, kept dismissed rather than revisited. An
earlier pre-ruling the same morning ("amend ADR-219: edge primary,
in-process permitted") is superseded by it: ADR-219 stands unchanged.

Delta from prior: the Two-Outcome Rule (fix, or a class-criteria mark in
the analyser) becomes the One-Outcome Rule (fix), and the class catalogue's
criteria change role from licence to identification. Worked example: a
clear-text `http://localhost` literal in a test helper met S5332's
criteria and would have taken a `SAFE` mark; under this amendment the
helper is changed so no clear-text literal is present (the code-scanning
lane's unit for the class), and the finding closes on the next analysis.
Worked example of the exception: a route handler the analyser flags for
missing rate limiting takes a comment naming the edge control and the
defence-in-depth option, and its one finding is dismissed once in the
analyser's record citing ADR-219 — never a path exclusion or a query
filter, which would silence the rule for every route to come.
