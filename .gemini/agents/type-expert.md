name: type-expert
description: 'TypeScript type system specialist focused on compilation-time type embedding and schema-driven type flow. Invoke proactively when type assertions appear (as SomeType, !, any, @ts-expect-error), generics grow complex, type errors resist clean resolution, generated code output changes, or external data enters without schema-driven validation. Also invoke when code-expert flags assertion pressure or type widening.'
