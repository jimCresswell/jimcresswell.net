description: "Create and verify a lane worktree: the branch cut explicitly from origin/<base>, the inherited commit identity verified with no worktree-scoped override, deps installed, .env.local carried, a draft PR at first push; in a detected ChatGPT Work cloud host, static branch/base checks only with execution routed to draft-PR CI. Use for a new lane or a misbehaving worktree (commits attributed to nobody, missing env, hook failures). Not for switching branches in place, changing session residency alone, or disposing of a worktree. Wrong looks like: EnterWorktree fresh mode basing the branch on the principal's coordination HEAD so the lane PR ships foreign commits; a worktree-scoped identity override that outlives the next correction."
