/**
 * ESLint rule that bans `throw` statements in favour of the Result pattern.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Repository doctrine (`.agent/rules/use-result-pattern.md`) is that errors are part
 * of the type signature: a function that can fail returns `Result<T, E>`, and
 * the compiler forces every caller to handle both arms. A `throw` re-introduces
 * the invisible control-flow edge the Result pattern exists to remove. Genuine
 * boundary translations — re-expressing an error from a library that cannot
 * return a `Result` — belong at a single named edge, translated to a `Result`
 * there, not scattered through the call graph.
 *
 * Its severity is set in `configs/recommended.ts`, which records why.
