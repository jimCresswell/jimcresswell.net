/**
 * Claude Code `PreCompact` observer hook: record what the harness sends at a
 * compaction, and answer without ever blocking it.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The thin impure entry. It reads stdin, binds the measurements to `node:fs`
 * (`claude/pre-compact-observe/node-io.ts`), and hands them to
 * `observePreCompact` (`claude/pre-compact-observe/observe.ts`), which
 * appends the observation and chooses the answer. It then writes that answer,
 * one JSON line, to stdout, once.
 *
 * Every path it controls answers `continue: true` and exits 0; it never exits
 * 2, the one code on which the harness blocks a compaction. A thrown Error is
 * answered fail-open with its reason. Throws are narrowed through
 * `failureAsError` (owner ruling, 2026-07-20). A non-Error narrowed at an
 * inner boundary (the stdin read, the append's file-system edge) reaches the
 * entry as a TypeError and is answered fail-open. One that reaches the
 * entry's catch un-narrowed crashes the hook with exit 1, which the wrapper
 * logs. No path exits 2. A module that cannot load, or a missing build, also
 * exits 1, before any of this runs; the harness treats exit 1 as a
 * non-blocking error (the observable-hook-failures rule).
 *
 * It sets `process.exitCode` and never calls `process.exit`, so a write to a
 * pipe still pending when the script ends is flushed before the process
 * exits.
 *
