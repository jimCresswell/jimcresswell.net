/**
 * The Codex registry (closure item 6, 2b-ii, slice A2): `.codex/config.toml` is a hand-kept
 * head (the host's own settings: the file opener, the features, the hooks) followed by one
 * `[agents."<name>"]` block per Codex adapter, each carrying the adapter's description and
 * its config file. The head is kept verbatim up to the first block; the blocks are rendered
 * from the declarations, sorted by name, so the registry names exactly the adapters the
 * generator renders (`render-codex-adapter.ts`). The tail starts at the first line that names
 * the agents table at all, however loosely written, and admits nothing but blocks in the
 * rendered shape (the header, the description, the config file, in that order, blank lines
 * between): a foreign line there (a section a hand placed after the registry, a header
 * written with leading whitespace or an inline comment, a field outside its place in a
 * block, a header with no fields) refuses naming that line rather than being dropped or
 * mistaken for head, and the cure is to move it above the first block or complete the
 * block. A description a TOML basic string cannot carry verbatim refuses as the adapter
 * itself does.
