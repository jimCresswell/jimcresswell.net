/**
 * The fold's clock, computed from the API's instants and never read by the
 * seat (the retrospective of 2026-10-10: a seat's reading of the push gate
 * was wrong by three times; the owner's bound on a fold is wall time and
 * nothing in the estate measured it). Pure: the reading arrives validated
 * from `fold-clock-reading.ts`; this module reduces, subtracts and formats
 * through `fold-clock-format.ts`.
 *
 * Instants: the ready-mark (the last `ready_for_review`, else the pull
 * request's opening), checks green (the latest passing completion among the
 * base branch's REQUIRED contexts on the tip — the merge door's own
 * definition for the records class, never every check-run, since a vendor's
 * review runs as a check-run of its own; a context is judged by its LATEST
 * run, as GitHub judges it, and a commit status counts as a run of its
 * context because a required context may be a status that publishes no
 * check-run), each vendor review round (`fold-clock-rounds.ts`), the merge,
 * and the successor's first check-run start when a successor tip is named.
 * Every interval is minutes from the ready-mark to one decimal, so a ledger
 * row carries the fold's shape in one line.
