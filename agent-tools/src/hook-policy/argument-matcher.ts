/**
 * The argument-aware matcher for the Bash guard (`match: 'argv'`).
 *
 * A string fingerprint cannot close the spelling space of a destructive
 * invocation: git resolves any unique prefix of a long option (`--h` is
 * `--hard`), accepts mode flags in any position (`git reset HEAD~1 --hard`),
 * and `rm` takes its short flags split, clustered, capitalised, or spelt
 * long (`-r -f`, `-Rf`, `-rvf`, `--recursive --force`). PR #100's review
 * rounds enumerated those spellings one by one and the list never closed.
 * This matcher reads the invocation the way the command's own parser does
 * and matches on the PARSED options, so one policy entry (`git reset --hard`,
 * `rm -rf`) names the mode rather than a spelling of it.
 *
 * The matcher is precise where the token-subsequence mode is broad: an
 * operand after `--` is never an option, options belong to the command in
 * their own shell segment, an option a later one overrides is gone (a
 * forced removal followed by the interactive flag is interactive), and
 * words are read as the command receives them
 * (quotes removed, so `rm '-rf'` is a forced removal and `"rm -rf"` is one
 * word that invokes nothing). It sees a command substitution's body,
 * unquoted or double-quoted, and the script a shell interpreter is given
 * (`-c` on the sh-like shells; quoted, escaped or ANSI-C quoted) as nested
 * commands, two levels deep;
 * it does not expand variables or tildes, resolve aliases, shell functions
 * or git config aliases, read a script on stdin, or know another command
 * with the same effect (`find -delete`, a scripting language, `rimraf`).
 * The guard's promise is PDR-044 innate immunity — fast, broad accident
 * prevention — not resistance to a bypass sought on purpose; and because
 * the host treats a hook timeout as an allow, matching is linear in the
 * command line so its cost is never driven by the input it judges. The
 * broad modes remain available beside it; which entries move onto this one
 * is the policy's decision, taken entry by entry.
