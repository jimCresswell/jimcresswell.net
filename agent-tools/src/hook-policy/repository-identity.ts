/**
 * Which git repository a file belongs to, for a content block whose concept
 * covers only this repository's own files (`excludes_other_repositories`).
 *
 * @remarks
 * A repository is known by its common git directory: a primary checkout's
 * `.git` directory, which every worktree of it shares through the `gitdir`
 * line of its `.git` file and the `commondir` file beside that gitdir. So
 * this repository's worktrees read as this repository wherever they sit on
 * disk, and a checkout of any other repository reads as another. Two common
 * directories are compared by identity (device and inode on disk), never by
 * spelling, so a path spelt in another letter case, through a firmlink or
 * through a symbolic link names the one repository it reaches.
 *
 * The walk starts where the file really is (links followed to where the write
 * lands) and climbs to the nearest `.git` entry, reading the disk only through
 * the {@link RepositoryProbe} seam. A git directory counts only when git itself
 * would accept it: a valid `HEAD` in the git directory itself, and `objects/`
 * and `refs/` directories git can enter in its common directory.
 *
 * A file reads as in another repository only when its repository is found
 * and differs from this one's. A file in no repository, a `.git` entry that
 * cannot be read or is neither a directory nor a file, a `commondir` that
 * cannot be read, a path deeper than the climb allows, a relative path, or
 * an unknown own repository all read as not another repository, so an
 * exempting block keeps applying: the exemption fails closed, never open.
 *
