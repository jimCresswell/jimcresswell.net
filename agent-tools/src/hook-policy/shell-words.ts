/**
 * Shell-word segmentation for the argument-aware Bash-guard matcher.
 *
 * Splits a command line into simple-command segments of words the way a
 * shell would read it far enough for option matching. What the words are:
 * the literal text after quote removal (`rm '-rf' dir` gives `rm` the word
 * `-rf`, exactly as the shell does; the ANSI-C `$'…'` form is a quote whose
 * escapes are decoded), with a backslash escaping the next character (inside
 * double quotes only the characters bash lets it escape) and a
 * backslash-newline continuing the line; a command substitution (`$(…)` or
 * a backtick pair), unquoted or inside double quotes, stays inside its word
 * and its body — balanced past quoted and escaped parentheses — is carried
 * alongside as a nested command; a comment from an unquoted `#` at a word
 * start is dropped. What ends a segment: the
 * command-list and pipeline operators (`&&`, `||`, `|`, `|&`, `;`, `&`), a
 * newline, and a bare sub-shell or group parenthesis, so an option is only
 * ever read against the command in its own segment. The `&` or `|` of a
 * redirection (`2>&1`, `&>log`, `>|file`) stays inside its word: the shell
 * removes a redirection before the command runs, so an option after it
 * still belongs to the same command. A here-document body is the command's
 * data, not commands, and is dropped — except the substitutions the shell
 * runs inside a body whose delimiter is unquoted, kept as nested commands.
 *
 * What the scanner does not do, by design: expand variables or tildes,
 * resolve aliases or shell functions, or read a script arriving on stdin.
 * A word it produces is what a command would see in `argv` only when no
 * expansion intervenes.
 *
