/**
 * Plan-state recomputation model (R0b, F5 "one engine, two adapters"): the
 * closed types the deterministic engine consumes and emits. Recorded status
 * is a CLAIM; recomputed evidence is held equal to it in both divergence
 * directions (`plan-node-schema.v0.md` V0.1 §1).
 *
 * GATE-SEMANTICS TABLE (the contract; `decideGateVerdict` implements it):
 *
 * | Row class                    | Gate effect          |
 * | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
 * | `recorded-done-but-red`      | RED (exit non-zero)  |
 * | `recorded-pending-but-green` | RED (exit non-zero)  |
 * | `unmapped-status`            | counted, never gates |
 * | `no-evidence`                | counted, never gates |
 * | `attested`                   | counted, never gates |
 * | `consistent`                 | green                |
 *
 * Over-band UNMAPPED (strictly more than 20% of rows) is a named HALT — an
 * `Err` before any report exists (mapping-table mis-fit, inspect the table);
 * distinct from a refusal on malformed input and from a RED report. A zero-row
 * input is the named `vacuous` class: reported, and the GATE refuses to pass
 * on it (a gate that scanned nothing must not pass) — never silently green.
 *
 * R1 PRECONDITION (deferred by design, the F2-precedent flag): the five
 * recomputable proof kinds have NO executors in R0b — evidence enters the
 * engine as injected typed verdicts (fixture-driven; the DI seam). Before
 * r1's audit-mode run can produce the claim-vs-derived divergence report,
 * per-kind executors must land, and each owes its OWN prove-it-fires
 * discrimination proof (P4 is NOT discharged by this module's engine-level
 * mutation proofs).
