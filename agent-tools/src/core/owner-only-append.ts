/**
 * One owner-only append: text appended to a file held private to the invoking
 * user.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The shared descriptor-level appender for machine-local logs that carry
 * owner-only content (session ids, project paths, raw payloads). It formats
 * nothing: the caller owns the text, and decides what a failure means.
 *
 * {@link appendOwnerOnly} runs these steps, in order, each a possible
 * failure:
 *
 * 1. `uid` — read the invoking user's uid, and refuse before touching
 *    anything when there is none. Node gives a process no uid on Windows and
 *    Android. Without one the owner check below cannot run, and on Windows
 *    the modes set below cannot make a file owner-only either: access is
 *    governed by ACLs, and `fchmod` reaches only the read-only flag. Writing
 *    anyway would put owner-only content in a file readable by whoever the
 *    ACL admits, so the append refuses, as any owner-only write does on
 *    Windows;
 * 2. `mkdir` — create the directory recursively at 0o700 if it is absent. The
 *    mode applies only to a directory it creates: an existing directory, or a
 *    symlink to one, is left as it was;
 * 3. `open` — open the file through {@link appendOpenFlags}, creating it at
 *    0o600;
 * 4. `fstat` — refuse the descriptor unless it is a regular file, owned by the
 *    invoking user, with exactly one link. A second link is another name for
 *    the same bytes, in a place and under a mode the caller did not choose;
 * 5. `lstat` — refuse unless the path's own entry, not following a symlink,
 *    is a regular file with the descriptor's device and inode. It refuses a
 *    name swapped since the open, and, where the open has no no-follow flag,
 *    a symlink at the name, which that open follows, as
 *    `skills-adapter-generate/read-regular-file.ts` does. No-follow stays as
 *    defence in depth where it exists;
 * 6. `fchmod` — set the file to 0o600, retightening a file an earlier writer
 *    left readable by others;
 * 7. `write` — write every byte, then `close` the descriptor, which is closed
 *    on every path after a successful open.
 *
 * The outcome is a Result (the Result pattern). A failure names the step and a code:
 *
 * - the errno code of a failed call, or `UNKNOWN` when the failure carried no
 *   error-code identifier;
 * - or one of the refusals `NO_POSIX_OWNERSHIP` (at `uid`),
 *   `NOT_REGULAR_FILE`, `NOT_OWNER` and `HARD_LINKED` (all at `fstat`),
 *   `NOT_SAME_FILE` (at `lstat`) and `NO_PROGRESS` (at `write`).
 *
 * It never carries a path or an error message, which can name one, so a
 * caller can show it anywhere.
