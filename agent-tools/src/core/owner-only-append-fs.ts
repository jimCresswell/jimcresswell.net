/**
 * The file-system port of the owner-only append, and its one real binding.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `appendOwnerOnly` (`owner-only-append.ts`) reaches the file system only
 * through {@link OwnerOnlyAppendFs}, so its behaviour is proven against an
 * in-memory fake (the injected-seams rule). The port returns Results;
 * {@link nodeOwnerOnlyAppendFs} is the single edge where `node:fs` throws
 * become them (the Result pattern), keeping each failure's code and dropping its
 * message, which names the path. The port also supplies the open flags, so
 * the append never reads `node:fs` constants and a fake can model its own.
