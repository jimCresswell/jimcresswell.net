/**
 * A git remote URL, read as the host and the `owner/repo` path it names. Pure.
 *
 * A parser for three of the forms git accepts: `https://host/owner/repo`,
 * scp-style `user@host:owner/repo` and `ssh://user@host/owner/repo`, each with
 * or without `.git`; any other form reads as no repository. Plain `http://`
 * is one of the others: what a remote advertises over an unauthenticated
 * transport, its default branch included, is not something a caller should
 * trust. A slash after the host needs a scheme, since git reads
 * `host/owner/repo` as a local path. Callers decide what the parts mean:
 * `merge-bot push` trusts an origin only when the host is github.com.
