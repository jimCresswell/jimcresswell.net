/**
 * The POSIX shell a smoke or fixture spawns, resolved by ABSOLUTE path.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Spawning `sh` by name lets the OS search `PATH` (SonarCloud S4036, "OS
 * commands should not rely on PATH resolution"), and pinning the child's
 * `PATH` does not clear the finding: the analyser flags the by-name call
 * whatever `env.PATH` holds (the `git` history of this is in
 * `trusted-git.ts`). This resolver returns the shell from a fixed,
 * platform-partitioned allowlist of complete paths, drawn from the same
 * directories `smoke-tests/trusted-shell-directories.ts` hands children as
 * their whole `PATH`: `/usr/bin` and `/bin` on POSIX; Git for Windows'
 * `usr\bin` and `bin` on win32, where the shell is `sh.exe`. When none
 * exists it returns `err` naming every searched path, so a missing shell
 * reads as itself and not as a downstream `ENOENT` (the `Result` shape of
 * its `gh` sibling, `resolveTrustedGh`).
 *
 * `platform` is injected (defaulting to `process.platform`) so both
 * branches are provable from any host.
 *
