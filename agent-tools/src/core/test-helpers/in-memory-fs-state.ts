/**
 * The state and path model of the in-memory file system behind the owner-only
 * append's port, for tests.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Paths are absolute POSIX strings on every platform, handled with
 * `node:path`'s `posix` functions, never the platform's own, so the fake keys
 * its entries identically on Windows. The root directory always exists. A
 * directory path is walked one component at a time from the root, as the
 * POSIX kernel does:
 *
 * - a directory is entered;
 * - a symlink is followed one hop to its target, which must be a directory
 *   (a dangling link is ENOENT, a link to anything else ENOTDIR);
 * - any other entry is ENOTDIR;
 * - an absent component is ENOENT, unless the walk creates it (a recursive
 *   mkdir).
 *
 * The open modelling lives in `in-memory-fs-open.ts`; the public constructor
 * in `in-memory-owner-only-append-fs.ts`. It performs no IO.
 *
