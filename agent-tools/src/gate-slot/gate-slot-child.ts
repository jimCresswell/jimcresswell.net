 * Every signal goes to the whole group, because the gate's real work sits
 * below the process spawned here (the pnpm launcher is a shell script that
 * does not exec, and pnpm runs its scripts under `sh -c`). SIGINT, SIGTERM
 * and SIGHUP sent to the wrapper are passed on to the group, and so is one
 * that lands before the spawn has handed back its kill; the wrapper stays
 * until the child has ended, so it can free the slot. A passed-on signal, or
 * the bound at `maxMs`, starts a grace period of `graceMs`, after which the
 * group gets SIGKILL. However the child ends, its group is then swept with
 * SIGKILL until the kernel reports it gone, before the slot is freed:
 * anything still in the gate's own group is a straggler (a process meant to
 * outlive the gate leaves the group through setsid or setpgid), and none may
 * keep loading the host outside the bound. A group the sweep cannot clear is
 * reported, and the gate fails. A wrapper that is itself SIGKILLed cannot
 * pass anything on; its child's group runs on.
