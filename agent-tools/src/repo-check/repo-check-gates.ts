/**
 * The format and markdown gates: the process edge that runs each tool over

 * @remarks
 * A tracked gate reads the tree through {@link readTrackedTreeResult}, which fails
 * closed: a gate whose git read failed checked nothing, so it fails rather
 * than pass, and a check refuses a tracked file the working tree has lost
 * ({@link planUnlessLost}). Its files run in chunks within the host's
 * {@link argvBudgetBytes}, one run after another, and the gate fails if any
 * chunk fails.
