/**
 * The shellcheck gate: every tracked shell script, linted by the pinned
 * shellcheck, failing on any finding at any severity.
 *
 * shellcheck is a system binary, not a package dependency, so the gate reads
 * the pin from the installer, runs the repository's `.tools/bin` shellcheck
 * when the installer has put one there and the shellcheck on PATH otherwise,
 * and asks it for its version: a missing, foreign or other-version shellcheck
 * fails the gate with the remedy. The universe is git's tracked tree
 * (`repo-check-universe.ts`), less the vendored skills a tracked `skills-lock.json` pins
 * (`repo-check-skills-lock.ts`), and a tracked shell script the working tree
 * has lost with the change unstaged fails the gate by name, since a commit
 * carries content the gate cannot read. Whether a lost file is a script, or
 * carries a shebang the gate refuses, is read from the index git commits, not
 * the disk, so a lost file of any other kind, such as a peer's staged deletion
 * that a pathspec commit's index still names, is not refused. Each file's opening bytes (`HEAD_BYTES`) are read to
 * classify its shebang, which finds the extensionless scripts and fails any
 * shebang the classification refuses (an unrecognised form, or a non-shell
 * form on a file whose path makes it shell), and each script is read for
 * directives that would silence the lint. The pure verdicts live in
 * `repo-check-shellcheck-files.ts` and `repo-check-shellcheck-version.ts`, and
 * the edges in `repo-check-shellcheck-runtime.ts`. Paths are relative to the
 * working directory, which agent-tools' `repo-check` script sets to the
 * repository root (`cd ..`).
 *
 * `env` runs by its absolute path, `/usr/bin/env`, on every host the installer
 * pins. `shellcheck`, when no repository binary is installed, resolves through
 * PATH, as `gitleaks` does for the secrets leg. The gate is a lint, not a trust
 * boundary: whoever can write a PATH directory already runs code through every
 * tool resolved by name, and the version check pins what a run reports, not
 * which binary produced it. A tracked `.tools` path, in any case and whether
 * a directory or a link, fails the gate before any shellcheck runs, since the
 * gate would run a tracked `.tools/bin/shellcheck` as the pin.
 *
