/**
 * The root `check` script read as ordered legs, and what captured
 * `pnpm check` output says about how far the chain got.
 *
 * `pnpm check` first echoes its own script body, and that body names every
 * leg, so a substring match on a leg's name is true of every captured run.
 * What discriminates is the line pnpm prints when a leg's own script starts:
 * `$ ` followed by that script's body, on a line of its own. The legs are
 * joined by `&&`, so in a failed run the last leg whose start line appears is
 * the leg the chain stopped in. Pure: scripts and output in, legs out.
