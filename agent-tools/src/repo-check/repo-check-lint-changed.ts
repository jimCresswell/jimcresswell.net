/**
 * The pre-commit workspace lint: `turbo run lint` over the workspaces changed
 * since `HEAD` (and their dependents), skipped when that scope holds no task.
 *
 * Why the skip exists: turbo prints the warning "No tasks were executed as part
 * of this run." for every run whose task graph is empty, which is every commit
 * that changes no workspace (a root Markdown change scopes to the root package
 * alone, and the root declares no lint task). turbo 2.10 has no flag that makes
 * an empty scope a silent no-op (`turbo run --help`; the run reference at
 * turborepo.dev documents none), so a green docs-only commit printed a warning
 * every time. Readers learn to skip a warning that is always there; that is
 * the harm.
 *
 * Why turbo decides the skip: the step asks turbo for the task graph it would
 * run, a dry run under the same filter, rather than mapping changed paths to
 * workspaces itself. turbo's change detection (the working tree against
 * `HEAD`, dependents through `...`) is then the only answer, so the skip can
 * never disagree with the run it replaces.
 *
 * Why only the dry run is captured: it runs no task and leaves no process
 * behind, so a pipe on its output is safe. The lint run itself keeps inherited
 * output, because a pipe over a running gate chain is the F-112 failure
 * (`repo-check-runner.ts` and `core/file-backed-child.ts` carry the account).
