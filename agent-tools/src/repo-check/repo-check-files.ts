 * whatever this machine happens to carry (a generated read model, an editor's
 * workspace file, build output) and so proves the machine, not the repository:
 * the "green here, red in CI" class. Existence comes from git; ownership (which
 * tracked files a tool formats) stays declared in each tool's own ignore
 * settings, which both tools still apply to paths named explicitly: prettier's
 * `.prettierignore` and markdownlint-cli2's `ignores`, and `.gitignore` for
 * both (prettier reads it by default; the markdownlint config sets `gitignore`).
 *
 * The tracked tree of a large repository does not fit one command line, so the
 * files are run in chunks under a byte budget ({@link argvChunks}).
