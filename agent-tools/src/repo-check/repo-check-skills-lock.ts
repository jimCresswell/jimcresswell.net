/**
 * The vendored skills: the directories `skills-lock.json` pins under
 * `.agents/skills/`, whose files are the upstream's bytes and are never edited
 * here, so the shellcheck gate leaves them out.
 *
 * The lock is the one record of which skills are vendored, and the gate reads
 * it rather than a list of its own, so a skill that joins or leaves the lock
 * joins or leaves the exclusion in the same change. A skill written in this
 * repository is not in the lock and is linted. An entry counts only when it carries what the lock's tool records
 * for a vendored skill, its source and its content hash, so a bare key cannot
 * take a directory out of the lint. A lock this module cannot read fails the
 * gate; a repository with no lock has no vendored skills.
