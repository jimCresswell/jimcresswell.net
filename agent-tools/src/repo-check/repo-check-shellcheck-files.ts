/**
 * The shellcheck gate's pure mapping: which tracked files are shell scripts,
 * which shebangs fail the gate, which comments would silence shellcheck, which
 * bash scripts lack the bash floor, and the argv that lints them.
 *
 * A shell script is a tracked file named `*.sh` or `*.bash`, a file directly
 * in `.husky/` (husky runs every hook there with `sh`), or one whose first line
 * is a recognised shell shebang. The file names come from git
 * (`repo-check-files.ts` carries why); the contents are read from the working
 * tree.
 *
 * The shebang classification is closed, following the closed-shape rule
 * (`.agent/rules/closed-shape-design-optionality.md`). The first line, less a
 * trailing carriage return, is matched exactly against the forms the tracked
 * files use (`SHEBANG_FORMS`), never parsed. Any other first line starting
 * `#!` fails the gate, and so does a non-shell form on a file whose path makes
 * it shell, so no script escapes the lint on an interpreter form the gate
 * cannot read. The falsifier: a real script that needs another interpreter
 * form, which widens `SHEBANG_FORMS` deliberately, by that form, in the change
 * that adds the script. The path rules stay as they are: a file with neither a
 * shebang nor a shell path has nothing to fail on, so dropping a path rule
 * would let its scripts escape silently.
 *
 * Every finding fails, and nothing outside the gate's own argv decides what
 * counts as one: a `.shellcheckrc` above the checkout and a `SHELLCHECK_OPTS`
 * in the environment never reach the run, and a `disable`, `shell` or
 * `extended-analysis` directive inside a script fails the gate itself, so
 * every check and the full analysis apply to every script. A script names its
 * shell with its shebang (shellcheck also infers bash from a `.bash` name), so
 * a sourced `.sh` library and every husky hook carry one of the shell forms.
 *
