/**
 * The review cost function — the seat-side guard the owner asked for after
 * PR #139 (2026-09-12: seven settlement pushes against a declared budget of
 * two, 98 comments, every finding correct, none exercised by a recorded
 * input, stopped only by the owner). An on/off round count would have fired
 * too; a cost function fires EARLIER the more expensive the loop is: more
 * findings, more comment volume, bigger and more frequent pushes, and pushes
 * that keep touching the same files (the signature of sampling one surface)
 * all raise a round's cost. The verdict is deterministic — thresholds, never
 * probabilities — because an agent that rolls dice at a gate is a timing
 * dependence. Every weight lives in the policy, calibrated against recorded
 * loops, never in the code path.
