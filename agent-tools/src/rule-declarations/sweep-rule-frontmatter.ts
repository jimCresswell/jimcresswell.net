/**
 * The sweep: derive every canonical rule's declaration from the hand-kept sources and write
 * it as the rule's frontmatter.
 *
 * Derivation is all-or-nothing: a rule name that is not a basename, an index row naming no
 * swept rule, a rule whose sources cannot be read or are missing, or a rule that has no index
 * row, refuses the whole sweep and nothing is written. Writing then proceeds file by file,
 * each write atomic (`sweep-fs.ts`), so an error part-way leaves whole rules written and the
 * rest untouched; git shows which, and a re-run finishes the rest because a rule that already
 * carries a frontmatter block is left as it is and reported, once its index row has been
 * read. A declared rule's projections are not read: they are generated outputs of
 * `portability:fix`, not sources, and the generated Claude adapter carries `paths` as a YAML
 * sequence this hand-kept reader does not parse (the #74 round-four finding, 2026-09-14).
 * The same property lets the sweep run again for rules that arrive after the first pass. The
 * file system is an injected port so the sweep is proven over an in-memory tree.
 *
 * Every source is admitted by entry kind before it is read (`lstat` on the source path, so its
 * leaf entry is never followed; anything but a regular file refuses the sweep), and every write
 * targets a path the read admitted (the rule file itself, in place), so the read guard covers
 * the write path. The check-to-use window between them is accepted for a one-shot instrument
 * run by hand on a tracked tree; the fd-anchored reader in `skills-adapter-generate/` closes it.
 *
 * This is a transplant instrument as much as a one-off: any host that arrives with a
 * hand-kept rules index and hand-kept triggers runs the same sweep to mint its declarations.
 *
