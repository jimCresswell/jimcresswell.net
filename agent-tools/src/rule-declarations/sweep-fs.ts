/**
 * The file-system port of the rule-frontmatter sweep, with its `node:fs` default.
 *
 * The port classifies an entry before the sweep reads it: `entryKind` uses `lstat` on the path,
 * so its leaf entry is never followed and a symlinked source is refused rather than read or
 * written through (a link in an ancestor directory is outside this guard). Writes go through
 * the estate's atomic text writer (temp file, sync, rename), so a failed write never leaves a
 * half-written rule behind; `realSweepFs` takes the writer as a parameter so that property is
 * proven over an injected file system rather than asserted by name. `readSource` is the one
 * admitted read the sweep performs: every refusal it returns names the repo-relative path.
