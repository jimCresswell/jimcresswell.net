/**
 * The declaration a canonical rule carries in its frontmatter.
 *
 * A rule under `.agent/rules/` declares how it is loaded — always (`core`), or on a named
 * trigger (`situational`), optionally scoped to file globs — and one sentence of what it is
 * for. The declaration is intended as the one source for every projection of the rule (the
 * row in `RULES_INDEX.md`, the Cursor trigger under `.cursor/rules/`, the Claude and
 * `.agents` pointer adapters); the generator that derives those projections from it is the
 * next change, and until it lands they remain hand-kept (`compute-dont-hope`).
 *
 * The shape is closed: a core rule has no trigger and no globs (it is always loaded, so a
 * scope would be meaningless), and a situational rule always names its trigger.
