# Rule declarations

A canonical rule under `.agent/rules/` declares how it is loaded and what it is for in its
frontmatter (`classification`, `description`, `trigger`, `globs`). The declaration is the one
source for the rules index, the Cursor triggers and the Claude and `.agents` adapters
(`compute-dont-hope`): `pnpm portability:fix` renders them from it and `pnpm portability:check`
recomputes them byte for byte, so none is ever edited by hand. This module owns the
declaration shape, its reader, the renderers, the drift check, and the sweep that minted the
declarations from the surfaces that carried them by hand before.

- [`rule-declaration.ts`](rule-declaration.ts) — the closed declaration shape;
  [`read-rule-declaration.ts`](read-rule-declaration.ts) reads it from a rule's frontmatter.
- [`render-rule-projections.ts`](render-rule-projections.ts) — the index and the three
  adapters as pure functions of the declarations, each platform's documented shape. The
  portability validator's `rule-projection-validation.ts` wires them into
  `portability:check` and `portability:fix`, over the drift check it shares with the
  sub-agent adapter leg
  ([`validators/portability/projection-drift.ts`](../validators/portability/projection-drift.ts)).
- [`parse-rules-index.ts`](parse-rules-index.ts), [`parse-cursor-trigger.ts`](parse-cursor-trigger.ts),
  [`parse-claude-rule-adapter.ts`](parse-claude-rule-adapter.ts) — readers for the three
  hand-kept sources, over the line-based [`frontmatter-lines.ts`](frontmatter-lines.ts) reader
  the platforms' own tolerance requires.
- [`reconcile-rule-declaration.ts`](reconcile-rule-declaration.ts) — the most-specific-wins
  rule for sources that disagree, every reconciliation returned for listing.
- [`render-rule-frontmatter.ts`](render-rule-frontmatter.ts),
  [`render-reconciliation-report.ts`](render-reconciliation-report.ts) — the block a rule
  carries and the table a pull request lists.
- [`sweep-rule-frontmatter.ts`](sweep-rule-frontmatter.ts), its name boundary
  [`rule-name.ts`](rule-name.ts) (a rule is addressed by its basename alone, and an index row
  naming no swept rule refuses the sweep; either way before any rule path is built), its projection
  reader [`rule-projections.ts`](rule-projections.ts) (the Cursor trigger and the Claude
  adapter, read and parsed together; an already-declared rule still needs both), its
  file-system port [`sweep-fs.ts`](sweep-fs.ts) (regular files only; a link is never read or
  written through; the one admitted read) and its entry
  [`rule-frontmatter-sweep.ts`](rule-frontmatter-sweep.ts) — the all-or-nothing sweep over the
  tracked rules; `pnpm --filter @engraph/agent-tools rule-frontmatter-sweep [--write]`.

The sweep is a transplant instrument: a host that arrives with a hand-kept index and triggers
runs it once to mint its declarations, then the generator owns the projections. The sweep and
the hand-kept readers it runs on are retained for that purpose alone; the running estate never
reads the projections back.
