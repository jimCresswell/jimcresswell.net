 * `id` on this generic read schema. The one strict exception is
 * commit-queue INTENT rows, which require `id` AT PARSE in both registry
 * read paths (see {@link parseIntentAgentId}); the write-side schema
 * `collaborationAgentIdWriteSchema` requires `id` so write factories
 * cannot accidentally emit legacy shape.
