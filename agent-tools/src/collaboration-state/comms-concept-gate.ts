 * hook then fights the contamination — so the same two concept families the
 * hook enforces on doctrine surfaces are enforced at the comms write path.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated on comms: `sha-in-permanent-doc` (comms events
 * legitimately cite commit SHAs constantly — they are coordination signal,
 * not permanent docs) and `menu-framing` / `machine-local-path` (path-scoped
 * concerns whose comms-side value has no ratified mandate). Widening this
