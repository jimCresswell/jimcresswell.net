/**
 * The Result contract of the Ajv schema validator's own JSON boundary:
 * malformed text is a FAILURE VALUE, never a thrown escape from the
 * Result-typed slot. Every composed caller parses the text before this
 * validator runs, so this arm is unreachable through those paths — the pin
 * exists so the signature stays honest for the next direct caller.
 * Integration classification: the module walks to the schema directory at
 * import time and the validator reads the real schema files.
