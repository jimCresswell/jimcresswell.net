/**
 * The machine-local per-intent commit-queue store (owner ruling 2026-08-17,
 * rulings ledger row QUEUE-LOCAL): one JSON file per intent at
 * `.agent/state/collaboration/commit-queue/<intent-id>.json`, mirroring the
 * comms event store's file conventions (id-named files, atomic validated
 * writes, loud path-labelled parse failures). Queue state is ephemera —
 * never in version control (the collaboration-state ignore file covers the
 * directory), expiring one hour after its last write (`updated_at`).
 *
 * TTL discipline: reads treat an expired file as absent; every write
 * operation sweeps (deletes) the expired files it encounters. Deletion is
 * correct here by owner definition — TTL-expired queue state is ephemera,
 * not work. `expires_at` is stored for view parity and always derives as
 * `updated_at` plus exactly the TTL; the liveness decision reads
 * `updated_at`, never the stored derivative.
