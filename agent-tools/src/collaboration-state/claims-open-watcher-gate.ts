/**
 * The load-bearing half of the F-95 gate (Option B): `claims open` refuses to
 * stake a claim into a populated registry while this session is blind to the
 * comms stream — the founding pilot failure (a blind claim opened alongside a
 * simultaneous identical-branch claim).
 *
 * Split into two steps so the populated-vs-solo decision is made under the
 * registry lock and is therefore race-free:
 *
 * - `resolveWatcherVerdict` (async, OUTSIDE the lock) does the filesystem IO
 *   once to classify this session's watcher presence. Watcher staleness is
 *   3x-interval-grained, so reading it just before the lock is not a race.
 * - `assertNotBlindWithOtherAgents` (sync, INSIDE the transactional transform)
 *   evaluates `hasOtherLiveAgents` against the LOCKED registry snapshot and
 *   throws only when another agent is live AND the verdict is blind. Evaluating
 *   the population check inside the lock closes the solo-then-peer TOCTOU: an
 *   agent that read an empty registry but whose peer's claim lands before the
 *   write still sees the peer inside the transform and is refused.
 *
 * Solo-safe by construction: a session with no OTHER live agent in the locked
 * snapshot passes regardless of watcher state (the bootstrap fast-path).
