/**
 * Supervisor-death detection for the comms watcher (F-101 refined-(i)
 * kill-tree). A watcher is spawned by an agent session and runs in its OWN
 * process group (GNU `timeout` isolates it), so a CLEAN teardown
 * (Monitor `TaskStop`, SIGTERM, timeout expiry) group-kills the whole tree —
 * but a HARSH agent death (crash / SIGKILL) signals nothing, leaving the
 * watcher orphaned and writing a false-liveness heartbeat until the timeout
 * backstop fires (≤ 3600 s).
 *
 * This module cures the harsh path WITHOUT a host `Stop`-hook lease (which it
 * supersedes): the watcher is given the supervising session's pid via
 * `comms watch --supervisor-pid <pid>`, probes it once per poll cycle, and
 * self-exits within one cycle of that pid disappearing. The probe is a
 * signal-0 `process.kill`, injected through {@link SupervisorLivenessRuntime.processIsAlive}
 * so the behaviour is unit-testable without a real process.
