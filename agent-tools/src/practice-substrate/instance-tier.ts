/**
 * The substrate audit's instance tier: whether a surface the audit reads is
 * absent by design, asked of the repository and never of a hand-kept list.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A surface is instance tier exactly when the repository's ignore rules ignore
 * it and git does not track it, which is what `listIgnoredPaths` in
 * `core/repository-paths.ts` asks git; a fresh checkout, a worktree and CI
 * carry none of it. The disk is asked first: a surface the read found is
 * present and validated in full whatever the rules say, so the tier never
 * excuses content. Only an absent surface consults the probe. A probe git
 * could not answer fails closed: every absent surface then earns a blocking
 * finding of its own, and no other reader's findings are hidden.
