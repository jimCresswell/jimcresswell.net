/**
 * Skip-marker classification (SKILL: substantive reviews vs SKIPPED markers).

 * declaration, per the owner ruling 2026-07-21) settles the leg as SKIPPED
 * immediately; an unevaluable marker ("service unavailable") falls through
 * to the checks-green timeout arm instead.
 *
 * The phrase is looked for outside quotation: a double-quoted span or a
 * code span on one line is a reviewer reporting what was said, so a finding
 * that quotes a marker is still a review. A quoted LINE (`>`) is still read,
 * since a vendor posts its own marker in a blockquote, and a marker missed
 * there would read its body as a review.
