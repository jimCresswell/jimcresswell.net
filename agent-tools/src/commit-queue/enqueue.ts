 * Append a new commit intent, stamping the queue's order key. Claim rows

 * pointer exists to strand if a write dies between the claims file and the
 * per-intent store (crash-atomicity by construction, not by ordering).
 *
 * The caller supplies a DRAFT because `queued_seq` is derived from the live
 * queue and this function runs inside the claims-file transaction — which
 * is what makes the derivation safe. It is max-over-live + 1, so keys are
 * reused as the queue drains; relative order is all the queue needs.
 *
 * An intent id the live queue already carries is REFUSED, mirroring the
 * comms store's existing-id refusal: the store publishes one file per id,
 * so appending a duplicate would overwrite that file and silently discard
 * the peer's queued bundle. The store's exclusive-create path is
 * defence-in-depth behind this check, not a substitute for it — it catches
 * the case-alias no in-memory comparison can see.
