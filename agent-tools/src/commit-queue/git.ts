/**
 * Input for the intent-scoped staged-bundle read.

 * `pathspec` is a non-empty tuple: the scope of the read MUST be declared
 * and MUST contain at least one path. The caller is expected to pass the
 * owning commit-queue intent's `files` field so that the staged read
 * returns content for those files only, independent of any concurrent peer
 * staging activity in the shared git index. The compile-time non-empty
 * constraint prevents the silent fallback to whole-index reading that
 * would occur if `git diff --cached -- ` were invoked with an empty
 * pathspec list.
 *
 * `gitRoot` is the root of the INVOKING git worktree — never the
 * coordination home (F-138). Staged reads must see the index of the
 * worktree the agent staged in; from a linked worktree the primary
 * checkout's index is a different (typically empty) index entirely.
 *
 * `runGit` is an injection seam for unit tests; production callers omit
 * it and the default real-git invocation runs.

/**
 * Read the staged git bundle scoped to a declared pathspec.
 *
 * Each underlying git invocation appends `--` and the pathspec entries
 * so git filters the staged diff and the worktree short-status to the
 * intent's declared file set. Out-of-scope staged content authored by
 * peers does not appear in the returned bundle.
 *
 * The staged reads run rename-explicit (`--no-renames`): a staged rename
 * reports its deletion AND its addition, never a collapsed `R` pair. The
 * intent file list must therefore name both sides of a rename — which is
 * what the pathspec commit needs anyway: `git commit -- <new-path-only>`
 * builds a temporary index that still tracks the old path while the
 * worktree no longer has it, and every tracked-file validator in the
 * pre-commit gate then crashes on the phantom file (worked instance
 * 2026-07-16, the flag-path-resolve consolidation commit).
