/**
 * Which transcript entries are the owner speaking, and which are not.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The transcript attributes every prompt itself, and this module reads that
 * attribution, never the prompt's text: a peer's message or a scheduled prompt
 * reads like the owner's, and a list of text prefixes counted both.
 *
 * - **A user turn** carries `origin.kind` (who sent it) and `promptSource` (how
 *   it was submitted). It is the owner speaking when the origin is `human` and
 *   a `promptSource` is present: the harness also records the owner's slash
 *   commands as human-origin turns without one, and those are actions, not
 *   messages, arguments included: a line of several commands is written as one
 *   turn per command, each carrying the line's arguments, so counting them
 *   would count one line several times.
 * - **A message typed while a turn runs** is counted once, as mid-turn, in the
 *   form it finally took: the `queued_command` attachment, carrying the same
 *   `origin`, when the running turn absorbed it; or the turn whose
 *   `promptSource` is `queued` when it waited for the turn to end. Its
 *   `enqueue` record carries no attribution and is never counted. Counting
 *   turns alone misses every message a running turn absorbed.
 *
 * Everything else user-shaped — peer relays and teammate messages, scheduled
 * prompts, task notifications, usage-limit continues, compaction summaries,
 * skill bodies, shell escapes and interrupt markers — is excluded, and COUNTED
 * as excluded, so a caller can tell "the owner said nothing" from "the filter
 * removed everything". A predicate over a filtered set that reports only its
 * survivors lets an empty set read as a satisfied predicate, which is the
 * generator behind two merge-gate defects this estate met on 2026-09-16.
 *
