/**
 * Split a transcript's text into its lines, on the newline alone.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A vendor transcript is JSONL: one JSON object per line, terminated by a
 * newline. JSON leaves the Unicode line separator (U+2028) and paragraph
 * separator (U+2029) unescaped inside strings, and `node:readline` treats both
 * as line endings, so an entry whose text holds either arrives from it as
 * fragments that do not parse and is dropped whole. On 2026-10-01, over one
 * project directory's fifteen transcripts, that reader broke 15 well-formed
 * entries into 52 unparseable fragments; splitting on the newline alone left
 * none. This splitter is pure, so the rule is proved in process.
 *
 * A carriage return that ends a line is dropped with its newline; one inside a
 * line is the entry's own text and stays.
 *
