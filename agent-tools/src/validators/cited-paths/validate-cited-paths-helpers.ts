/**
 * Resolve repository-path citations in authored surfaces against the paths
 * that exist.
 *
 * Doctrine cites the surfaces it depends on by path: a rule points at a
 * pattern record, a skill at a sub-agent template, a directive at a
 * reference. When the target is absent the citation is a latent refusal — a
 * seat follows it and finds nothing. On 2026-09-13 forty such targets were
 * cited from twenty live files after a lineage transplant, and no gate saw
 * them: `validate-markdown-links` skips code spans by design. This helper is
 * the recur-proof half of the cure. Extraction lives in
 * `extract-path-citations.ts`; this module resolves each citation through an
 * injected existence check so it stays pure.
 *
