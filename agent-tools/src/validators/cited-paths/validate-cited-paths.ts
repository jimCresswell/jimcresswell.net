/**
 * Standalone validator that walks the live doctrine surfaces and fails when
 * a code-formatted `.agent/` or `docs/` path names a file or directory that
 * does not exist.
 *
 * The gate exists because doctrine depends on surfaces by path, and a
 * transplant, a move or a trim leaves the citation behind: on 2026-09-13
 * the rules, skills, directives and entry points cited thirty-five absent
 * targets (pattern records, sub-agent templates, research directories, a
 * skill at its pre-move path), and every one was a latent refusal for the
 * seat that followed it. `validate-markdown-links` cannot see the problem
 * (it skips code spans and fenced blocks by design).
 *
 * Scope is the doctrine a seat internalises — skills, rules, directives and
 * the entry points — not every authored surface: the plans, reports and
 * memory quote paths as history, and `.agent/practice-core/` cites the
 * lineage's layout by design (PDR-105). Widening the roots is a deliberate
 * step taken once the current findings are cured.
 *
 * A target resolves when the repository itself says it belongs: it is
 * tracked (a file, or a directory a tracked file implies), or git ignores it
 * by the repository's own rules — the untracked-by-design instance tier
 * (comms events, claims, the rendered log) and ignored local material. The
 * local disk is never consulted: on 2026-09-13 the leg was green on a
 * checkout that carried that state and red in CI, which does not.
 *
 * Wired into `pnpm docs-validators:check`.
