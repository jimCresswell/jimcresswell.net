/**
 * The ATX headings of a Markdown document, read outside fenced code.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Its own home because it is a Markdown concern, not a host-name one: the
 * host-name heading validator consumes {@link atxHeadings} and knows nothing of
 * fences. Fences are read as CommonMark reads them, the lines the plan corpus's
 * YAML fence scanner also draws: an opener is three or more backticks or tildes
 * after up to three spaces, a backtick opener's info string may not contain a
 * backtick (which keeps inline code from opening a block), and a closer is the
 * same character, no shorter, with nothing after the run. A heading quoted
 * inside a fence is therefore never read as one, and a line such as a closing
 * run followed by text leaves the fence open, as the specification says.
 *
 * Top-level fences only, which is the whole contract: a heading inside a
 * blockquote or a list item is not an ATX heading of the document, and the
 * Core's records do not nest fences in containers.
