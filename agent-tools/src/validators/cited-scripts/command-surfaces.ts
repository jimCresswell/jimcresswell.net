/**
 * The commands a gate actually runs, read for filtered pnpm calls:
 * package.json scripts, the git hooks and the CI workflow steps. pnpm exits 0
 * without running anything when a `--filter` matches no workspace project
 * (the pinned pnpm 12 honours `--fail-if-no-match` only as a command-line
 * flag, never as workspace config), so a renamed or mistyped package would
 * turn every call that names it into a silent pass. Every filtered call on
 * these surfaces must therefore name a real workspace and a script it
 * defines. Unfiltered calls are left alone: their scope depends on the
 * directory they run in, and pnpm exits 1 for a missing script without a
 * filter, at the root or in a workspace (probed on pnpm 12.4.2, 2026-09-25),
 * so they cannot pass silently.
