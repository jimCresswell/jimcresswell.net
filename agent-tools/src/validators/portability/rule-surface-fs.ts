/**
 * The projection leg's surface reads: the listing and the single-entry read, each a typed
 * outcome and never a throw past the leg's refusal contract; the mutations and the port the
 * leg takes are next door (`rule-projection-fs.ts`) over the same injected `SurfaceFs`.
 *
 * Nothing here follows a link. The listing walks every path segment of the surface with
 * `lstat`, so a surface root or ancestor that is a symlink is `foreign` before `readdir`
 * could follow it into another tree (the #74 round-one finding, 2026-09-14). The entry read
 * re-classifies the ancestor chain and the leaf unfollowed immediately before the open, then
 * reads through the estate's fd-anchored reader (`read-regular-file.ts`: one open with
 * `O_NOFOLLOW` and `O_NONBLOCK` where the host has them, so a link at the leaf fails the open
 * and a fifo cannot block it; the post-open device-and-inode identity check where it has
 * not), so a link swapped in at the leaf between the classification and the open is read as
 * `foreign`, never as its target (rounds three and four). Each mutation re-classifies its
 * ancestors and its leaf the same way and refuses when the entry is not what a projection
 * surface admits (a real directory above, an absent or regular-file leaf): a link at the leaf
 * is refused, never written through, replaced or unlinked. What remains, for the read as for
 * the mutations, is the window between an ancestor's classification and the open, mkdir,
 * rename or unlink under it: `O_NOFOLLOW` guards the leaf only, so a link swapped into an
 * ancestor there is followed and the act lands wherever it points
 * (`rule-projection-fs.ts` says what that admits); closed by nothing short of directory
 * descriptors, which Node does not expose. ENOENT is the only failure read as absence. The
 * `node:fs` calls are an injected port (`SurfaceFs`), so every order-of-operations claim is
 * proven over an in-memory tree.
