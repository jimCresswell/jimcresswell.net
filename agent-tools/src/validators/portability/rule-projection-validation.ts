/**
 * The rule-projection leg of the portability validator: every canonical rule's declaration is
 * read from its frontmatter, the index and the three adapters are rendered from those
 * declarations, and the surfaces are compared byte for byte. `--fix` writes what is missing or
 * drifted and removes what no declaration renders; without it, every difference is an issue
 * naming the cure.
 *
 * The leg refuses, with one issue and no write, whenever it cannot vouch for its input: a
 * declaration that cannot be read (a projection set rendered from a partial declaration set
 * would omit that rule and read as green), a canonical rule, index or projection file that is
 * unreadable (a crash past the leg would leave no refusal on record; an unreadable index read
 * as absent would be written over), a canonical rules directory that is absent, unreadable or
 * empty (acting on "no rules" would delete every projection), a regular file on the canonical
 * surface that is not a rule, and a symlink or special entry on any surface, as the surface,
 * or as one of its ancestors (a mutation under a linked ancestor would land outside the
 * projection tree; a link at the leaf is replaced, never written through). The
 * three adapter directories and the index are wholly generated outputs, so a regular file on
 * them that no declaration renders, whatever its extension, is stale and `--fix` removes it.
 * A canonical rule whose name a code span, a table cell or a path cannot carry is refused at
 * this boundary (`rule-name.ts`), before any projection is rendered from it.
 *
 * The comparison is byte for byte after one normalisation: every read is LF-normalised
 * (`toLfText`), so a CRLF checkout compares its content, never its line endings, and the
 * rendered projections are LF. The file system is an injected port (`rule-projection-fs.ts`),
 * every read and every mutation a typed outcome, so the leg is proven over an in-memory tree.
 *
