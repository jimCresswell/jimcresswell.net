/**
 * The projection leg's mutations and the port it takes: each write and removal re-classifies
 * its ancestors and its leaf unfollowed immediately before acting (`rule-surface-fs.ts`) and
 * refuses when the entry is not what a projection surface admits (a real directory above,
 * an absent or regular-file leaf), so a link, directory or special entry at the leaf is
 * refused, never written through, replaced or unlinked; the write is the estate's atomic
 * writer (a synced temp file renamed over the leaf, so a failed write leaves no partial
 * file) and the removal unlinks the leaf itself (the #74 round-three finding, 2026-09-14). What
 * remains is the window between an ancestor's classification and the mkdir, rename or unlink
 * into it: a link swapped in there is resolved by every later call, so the residue is a
 * directory created, a projection's text renamed over a regular file of the projection's
 * basename, or a regular file of a stale basename unlinked, wherever the link points. Named
 * here and closed by nothing short of directory descriptors, which Node does not expose.
 * Every outcome is typed: a refusal before the act and a failure of the act itself (a
 * permission, a full disk, a directory swapped in at the leaf) both return the reason, so
 * the leg ends a fix run at the first with what it had written on record.
