/**
 * The typed outcomes of reading a rule surface, and the pure classification
 * behind the listing. The projection leg acts destructively on a listing (`--fix`
 * removes a projection no rule renders), so a listing never reads a failure
 * as "nothing here": absence is ENOENT and nothing else, any other read
 * failure is `unreadable`, and an entry that is not a regular file is
 * `foreign` before any file is listed. A directory is foreign too: the rule
 * surfaces are flat (the canonical set admits no nested rule), and Claude
 * Code loads `.claude/rules/` recursively, so a nested hand-authored file
 * would be read by the platform and unseen by the gate (the 2a code-expert
 * finding, 2026-09-14). A regular file without the surface's extension is
 * listed as `stray`, never dropped: a `README.txt` on a wholly generated
 * surface is stale there (a `.DS_Store` a file browser drops is too, and
 * `--fix` removes it: the contract as stated) and a refusal on the canonical
 * one (the #74 round-one finding, 2026-09-14).
