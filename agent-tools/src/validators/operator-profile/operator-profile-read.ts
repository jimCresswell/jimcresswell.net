/**
 * Operator profile — reading one document. A document is opened read-only,
 * never through a symlink at the document itself (`O_NOFOLLOW`) and never
 * blocking on a fifo (`O_NONBLOCK`); the descriptor is then proven to be a
 * regular file, and on a host without `O_NOFOLLOW` proven to be the very
 * entry at the path (device and inode), before it is read whole and closed.
 * Each step has its own Result and nothing here throws. The same fused
 * open-verify-read shape as the adapter generator's `read-regular-file.ts`,
 * with this module's injectable handle and close-failure Results.
 *
 * A directory above the document is not guarded by the open: one swapped
 * for a link between the listing and the read is followed. That is the
 * stated boundary, as the rule-surface, rule-sweep and declared-adapter
 * readers state theirs: the Practice's own git never writes a link into the
 * profile tree (its runner checks out with `core.symlinks=false`), and any
 * other writer able to plant a link there can write a conforming document
 * directly. The error code helper lives here so that the filesystem module,
 * which imports this one, shares it.
