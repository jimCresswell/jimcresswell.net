/**
 * Pure helpers for the lineage-name leak validator.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The Practice was transplanted from another lineage (the provenance chain in
 * `.agent/practice-core/provenance.yml` tells that story). Its names belong in
 * the records that tell it, never on a live surface: a fixture URL, a package
 * manifest, a reference link or a comment carrying the lineage's organisation
 * or repository reads as this estate's fact and leaks the transplant into
 * product and tooling.
 *
 * The needle set is DECLARED once, in the `lineage-name` scoped block of
 * `.agent/hooks/policy.json`, the block the PreToolUse write-hook also reads,
 * so the commit and CI gate and the write-time guard match the same names and
 * exempt exactly the same files (the records: provenance, changelog, memory,
 * reports, plans, the transplant exploration; and the site's content
 * directory, where the lineage's organisation is a fact about the owner's
 * work). It is declared rather than derived because the chain cannot select
 * the lineage: it names the owner's own earlier repositories beside it, and
 * the organisation login appears in no provenance field.
 *
 * Matching is case-insensitive and literal: a lineage name is a name, not a
 * pattern, and a name in any letter case is the same leak. The block is
 * therefore refused when it is not a literal block, when it declares a name
 * the hook would read differently (padded, empty or duplicate), or when the
 * policy carries more than one such block (the hook evaluates every scoped
 * group; the gate must not read only the first).
 *
