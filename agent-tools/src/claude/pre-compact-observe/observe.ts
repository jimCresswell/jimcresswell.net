/**
 * The PreCompact observer's orchestration: measure, build the observation,
 * append it, and choose the answer.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The entry reads stdin and binds the measurements to `node:fs`; this module
 * does the rest, and takes the file system as an `OwnerOnlyAppendFs`, so a
 * test proves the same composition production runs.
 *
 * The observation is appended, through `appendOwnerOnly`, to
 * `.claude/logs/pre-compact-observe/observations.jsonl` under
 * `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. Every path answers `continue: true`:
 *
 * - the observation appended: the probe answer, carrying its marker;
 * - `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` unset or not absolute: the fail-open answer, and
 *   nothing written, because there is nowhere to write it;
 * - a platform without a uid, where the append would refuse: the fail-open
 *   answer naming that refusal once, with nothing measured and nothing
 *   written;
 * - the append failed: a three-line block naming the step and code is
 *   appended to `.claude/logs/hook-errors.log`, and the fail-open answer names
 *   the failure, and the hook-errors failure too when that append fails.
 *
 * The hook-errors block goes through `appendOwnerOnly` as well, so it
 * retightens that log, which the hook-error wrapper also writes, to 0o600,
 * keeping the wrapper's entries. That is harmless: the wrapper appends to it
 * as the same user, which 0o600 allows.
 *
 * Every failure it anticipates is a Result, and a measurement that cannot be
 * taken is `undefined`, so it does not throw. A throw is a defect: the
 * entry's catch narrows it through `failureAsError` and answers fail-open
 * with `thrownReason` (`capped-read.ts`). That path writes no hook-errors
 * block, so the reason reaches only the transcript. A thrown value that is
 * not an Error crashes the entry instead (exit 1, non-blocking, logged by
 * the hook-error wrapper).
