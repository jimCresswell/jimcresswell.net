/**
 * Owner-attention indicator for the Claude Code statusline.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The owner-jobs register (`.agent/state/collaboration/owner-jobs.md`,
 * untracked-by-design) is the estate's visible queue of items awaiting the
 * owner — created after the 2026-07-21 owner ruling that an attention item
 * recorded only in files the owner never reads is NOT surfaced ("'card'
 * means card UI, not some abstract invisible box of intent"). This module
 * is the glanceable half of that cure: the statusline renders a bell and
 * the open-job count whenever the register carries open items. Pure —
 * the adapter reads the file and passes the content in.
 *
 * THE REGISTER RENDER CONTRACT (canonical, tracked here because the
 * register itself is untracked and procedure-rendered): the register is a
 * PROJECTION of Linear — issues labelled `owner-ask`, assignee = the
 * authenticated Linear MCP viewer. Whichever agent interacts with the
 * owner updates Linear, then re-renders the file with: (1) a title
 * carrying the VIEWER's display name (never hardcoded — each developer's
 * checkout renders their own queue); (2) a generated-header HTML comment
 * carrying a `link:` line — the viewer's owner-ask issue-list URL, https
 * only, URL-safe characters only (this module rejects anything else
 * before it reaches the OSC 8 escape); (3) one `## <ID> <title>` section
 * per open issue with `- state:` lines this module counts. A register
 * rendered without the `link:` line degrades to the plain bell — valid,
 * just linkless. Dispositions belong on the Linear issue, never in the
 * file.
 *
