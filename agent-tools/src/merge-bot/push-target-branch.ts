/**
 * Which branch `merge-bot push` writes, which it refuses, and which commit it
 * writes there. Changes reach a
 * default branch through a pull request, never a direct push: `main` and
 * `master` refuse by name, and so does the repository's own default branch,
 * read from `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, which a clone sets and every worktree
 * shares. Names compare without case, since a branch differing only in case
 * from the default one breaks every fetch on a case-insensitive disk.
 *
 * The origin read is trusted only when origin names the repository the push
 * goes to, over https or ssh, since the push itself goes to the configured
 * repository's URL, never to `origin`. It is a snapshot: a fetch does not move an existing
 * `origin/HEAD`, so after the repository's default branch changes,
 * `git remote set-head origin --auto` refreshes it. Where the configured
 * repository's ruleset on the default branch binds the bot, as this
 * repository's does, GitHub refuses a direct push either way. Anything
 * unreadable fails the push rather than guessing.
