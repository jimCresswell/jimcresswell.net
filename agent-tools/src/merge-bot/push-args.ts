export const PUSH_USAGE = `merge-bot push [--branch <name>] [--json]
  Pushes the commit HEAD names to the repository's GitHub remote as the BOT,
  over one freshly minted installation token — the whole per-session
  credential-helper recipe as one command. The push itself IS the git binary;
  this command injects the bot identity and refuses by type. It pins what git
  is asked to write: that one commit, to refs/heads/<branch> alone, with tag
  following and submodule recursion turned off whatever the checkout
  configures. Its one addition is a bounded retry: when GitHub refuses the
  push at git's first request, before the pre-push hook runs, because the
  fresh token has not yet reached every edge, it runs git again with the same
  token after each wait on GitHub's advised backoff, naming each retry on
  stderr. Before each attempt, the first included, it stops (exit 1) when the
  token is within five minutes of its expiry, or when HEAD no longer names
  the commit the push began with: the pre-push hook validates the checkout,
  so a commit the gate did not run on is never pushed.

  The token reaches git ONLY through a 0600 file that lives exactly as long
  as the transfer, read by a static credential helper; the child environment
  carries the file's path, never the token — the pre-push hook chain inherits
  that environment, and an env dump there must never print a live credential.
  Never in argv, never in a remote URL, never on either output stream. An
  empty minted token fails before the transfer — an empty credential would
  make the helper emit an empty password and git would fall back to
  prompting, which is the signed-in human.

  There is no force flag and no --no-verify pass-through of any kind. Hooks
  run; a rejected non-fast-forward is answered by merging, never by
  overwriting.

  --branch names the target branch (default: the branch HEAD is on; a
  detached HEAD is a typed refusal, never a guess). The push always writes
  refs/heads/<branch>, so a full ref name (refs/...) refuses.
  --json puts EXACTLY the outcome object on stdout; git's transfer output is
  diagnostics and always goes to stderr.
  Exit map: 0 pushed, 1 operational failure (git's own non-zero exit, its
  stderr surfaced; or origin's default branch unreadable, or origin not the
  repository the push goes to), 2 usage, 3 typed refusal — main, master and
  the default branch origin names refuse in any case, because changes reach
  the default branch through pull requests.
