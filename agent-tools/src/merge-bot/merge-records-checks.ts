/**
 * "Checks green by name" for the records class. The verdict core holds
 * CHECKS-RUNNING on ANY pending check run, and a vendor's review runs as a
 * check run on the tip for the whole round (`copilot-pull-request-reviewer`
 * on 326's tip, 2026-10-10), so a records-class pull request with the
 * review requested at its ready-mark would wait the whole round under the
 * unqualified verdict — the cost the owner's ruling of 2026-09-03 removes.
 * The fold skill's full condition is exactly the contexts the base branch's
 * rules require, read at run time, and no other name: for a records-class
 * reading this module sets aside every PENDING check the rules do not
 * require and recomputes the verdict. A FAILED check of any name still
 * holds (a secret scan or a dependency review is information the merge must
 * not outrun), and a required context the tip has not reported yet is
 * pending by construction. The code class is untouched: every live check
 * binds it as before. The reads here (the pull request's base, the branch's
 * rules, then the files only when the narrowing would move the verdict) run
 * once per poll on CHECKS-RUNNING; a failure leaves the verdict as read with
 * the reason in its evidence, never ending the poll.
