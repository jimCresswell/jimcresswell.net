/**
 * The bot token's permission policy: which GitHub App permissions each kind of
 * bot work is allowed to mint.
 *
 * This table IS the policy. It lives in one reviewable place rather than at
 * every call site, because `merge-bot mint-token` is the estate's
 * bot-identity token source for ALL GitHub work agents do — merges, pushes,
 * PR bodies, comments, review replies — and a permission choice scattered
 * across shell recipes is a security decision with no reviewable list.
 *
 * A token carries ONLY the permissions its mint requests. That is why the
 * scope is required at the point of use and has no default: the most
 * privileged option must never be the silent one.
 *
 * ## Probed against the live endpoint, 2026-07-29 (MCP-385)
 *
 * Recorded so the next agent does not re-derive it by experiment:
 *
 * - **The mint fails LOUD on over-request.** Requesting an administration
 *   read, which this App does not hold, returned HTTP `422` with GitHub's own
 *   message, "The permissions requested are not granted to this
 *   installation." So no post-mint verification of the granted set is
 *   warranted — the failure names itself. (`mint-installation-token.unit.test.ts`
 *   pins that exact string; this is its live provenance.)
 * - **The grant echo carries more than was requested.** GitHub adds
 *   `metadata: read` to every token automatically. Any strict-equality check
 *   against a requested set would break on it.
 *
 * A `403` whose body reads exactly `Resource not accessible by integration`
 * is therefore a wrong-scope symptom, not a broken bot: the mint would have
 * failed at 422 if the permission were ungranted. Observed 2026-07-29 from a
 * contents write attempted on a `code-scanning-alerts` token. Narrow to that
 * body deliberately — a ruleset refusal and a rate limit are also 403s and
 * are not scope problems, and sending their reader to this table wastes them.
 */

/**
 * Permission levels this mint requests. GitHub also defines `admin`; the bot
 * never needs it, so the type excludes it rather than documenting it away.
 *
 * Note GitHub does not offer every level on every permission — `workflows`
 * has no read level, for instance, and requesting one is a runtime `422`.
 * The table below is the guard against that; this type is deliberately not
 * a model of GitHub's whole permission matrix.

   *

   * NOT for the upstream mirror: its run writes with the dispatcher's
   * ceiling, so a dispatch under this scope fails its reference update (run
   * 35240876819, 2026-09-17) — mint `upstream-mirror-dispatch` for that one
   * workflow. This scope stays actions-only for the carrier dispatch and for

   * ## Provenance, 2026-09-11
   *
   * Recorded because a seat got this wrong and the wrong answer reached a plan
   * node and a thread record. `gh workflow run` under a `pull-request-work`
   * token answers 403 `Resource not accessible by integration`, and that was
   * read as the bot APP lacking the permission — so the first dispatch of the
   * two upstream sync workflows was written up as an owner-only act. It is not:
   * the installation holds `actions: write` (read from
   * `GET /orgs/{org}/installations`), and the 403 was this table having no
   * scope that requests it. The header above says exactly this — an ungranted
   * permission fails the MINT with 422, so a 403 is always a wrong-scope
   * symptom — and the seat had read that line and still mis-attributed the
   * failure. Verify a capability against the grant, never against one token's
   * refusal.

   *
   * ## Provenance, 2026-09-17: the dispatched run inherits this token's ceiling
   *
   * A workflow run that the bot dispatches gets a `GITHUB_TOKEN` capped at the
   * permissions of the token that dispatched it, in addition to the job's own
   * `permissions:` block. GitHub's token documentation, read 2026-09-17,
   * states no such rule; the measurement is the warrant. Observed on the
   * upstream-mirror workflow:
   * every scheduled run fast-forwards the mirror branch (run 35212280055 moved
   * 57 commits at 10:47Z), and the first bot-dispatched run that reached the
   * same `PATCH git/refs` step (run 35240876819, dispatched under
   * `workflow-dispatch`, which carries `actions: write` alone) answered 403
   * `Resource not accessible by integration` at that step while its read
   * steps succeeded; `main` carries no ruleset and no branch protection, and
   * the job declares `contents: write`. Under a token carrying both
   * permissions, run 35241924531 fast-forwarded `main` by 19 commits.
   *
   * The MIRROR writes through the run's own token by design (its node's
   * decision 7: a reference the run token moves triggers no workflow, which
   * keeps CI off the mirror branch), so the token that dispatches it must
   * carry what the run writes with. The CARRIER workflow writes through an
   * App token it mints in the run, so its dispatch needs nothing beyond
   * `actions` and stays on `workflow-dispatch`. Named for the act that
   * writes, so no other dispatch holds a push-capable token for an hour it
   * never uses.
