/**
 * The doubles behind the `merge-bot retire` front-door tests. git is the
 * command's own port, answered by a constant world: what origin is set to,
 * what the readings are, who uses the branch, and what each ref's
 * compare-and-swap leaves, looked up by its full name. No argv, and no call
 * is recorded. GitHub gives one constant GraphQL answer for the run. The
 * mint is a fake that fails unless a case gives it one that answers, so a
 * run that must mint nothing proves it by its outcome, never by a count.
 * Paths that need git or GitHub to change between calls run against real
 * git in the smokes.
