 * planned, so a ref that moved after its proof is kept, never deleted, and a
 * symbolic ref is never followed to the ref it points at: `--no-deref`
 * deletes the symbolic ref itself, even one that appears between the read
 * and the delete (the decision refuses the symbolic refs it reads). git
 * exits 1 when the ref is already gone, when it has moved and when it cannot
 * be locked, so a failed delete is classified by re-reading the exact ref,
 * never by git's text. A name that lists no object but still exists is a
 * symbolic ref whose target is gone, made after the proof: `for-each-ref`
 * omits it and `show-ref --exists` finds it. It is never read as absent; the
 * delete fails and the name is kept.
