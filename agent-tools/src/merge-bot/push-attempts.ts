/**
 * The bounded retry around the bot's push. GitHub refuses a push at the ref
 * advertisement, the first request git makes and before it runs the pre-push
 * hook, while the push's freshly minted installation token has not yet reached
 * every one of GitHub's edge caches. GitHub Support describes that replication
 * and advises retrying at increasing intervals, 3 s, then 10 s, then 30 s
 * (second-hand: GitHub Support as quoted in aws-amplify/amplify-hosting#4080).
 *
 * So a push whose whole transcript is that refusal is tried again with the
 * same token after each wait in turn. Any other failure is final at once:
 * trying a failure after the hook ran again would run the whole gate again,
 * and a gate's own failure is the operator's to read. GitHub's answer to each
 * attempt is the readiness proof, so a push that can go through never waits.
