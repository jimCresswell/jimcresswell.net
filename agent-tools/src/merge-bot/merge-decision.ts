/**
 * The pure verdict→action mapping for `merge-bot merge` (MCP-508 slice 1).
 *
 * The command acts on exactly one verdict state for a code-class pull request —
 * `SETTLE-READY` — and refuses everything else with the verdict's own name in
 * the reason, so a supervisor reads the outcome by name, never by inference.
 * A records-class pull request (`change-class.ts`: every changed path
 * documentation or Practice prose, computed from the diff) also merges on the
 * verdicts that differ from SETTLE-READY only by the vendor leg — checks green,
 * zero unresolved threads, no suppressed finding held, the review requested but
 * not yet landed, or never served — the owner's ruling of 2026-09-03 ("Change
 * the merge policy instead") as behaviour; the review, when requested, is
 * harvested after the merge. The two additional gates carry the estate's
 * standing rulings: merge commits must still be allowed by the repo settings
 * (never a squash fallback), and the expected reviewer set must have been
 * DECLARED — a defaulted set can omit a configured-but-never-requested
 * reviewer, letting settlement read `SETTLE-READY` on a round that owed a leg.
