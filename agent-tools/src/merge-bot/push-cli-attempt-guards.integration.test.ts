/**
 * `merge-bot push` at the front door, checked before each attempt, the first
 * included: the token's own expiry leaves room to start, and HEAD still names
 * the commit the push settled. Each guard's own cases are
 * `push-attempt-guards.integration.test.ts`'s and the snapshot of HEAD is
 * `push-target-branch.integration.test.ts`'s; here the guards are composed
 * with the retry.
 *
 * Where a case needs the world to change between two attempts, it changes on
 * the wait the push itself asks for: the injected sleep sets what the clock or
 * the read of HEAD answers from then on. Nothing counts the push's queries.
