/**
 * Sandbox-safe gazetteer helpers — canonical subject ids inlined into every finder
 * dispatch.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This module is bundled INTO the sandbox artefact (imported for value by
 * `prompts.ts`), so it must stay zod-free — `Gazetteer` is imported as a TYPE ONLY from
 * `gazetteer-schema.ts` (erased at bundle time; the zod schema value never follows).
 * Shape matches OCE's `.agent/reports/restatement-audit/gazetteer.v1.json` (Director-compiled,
 * verified against a pinned tree): subjects grouped by category (gates, lanes, artefacts,
 * tools, …) are join keys, not exhaustive vocabulary — a finder that cannot match a
 * subject records it as free text (`subjectFromGazetteer: false`) rather than forcing a
 * gazetteer id.
 *
