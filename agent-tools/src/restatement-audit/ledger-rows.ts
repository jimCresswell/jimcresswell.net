/**
 * Ledger row contracts — the terminal disposition surface of one audited cluster.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Extracted from `schemas.ts` when the ledger grew its second row kind. The row set is a
 * discriminated union on `disposition` so every terminal state is VISIBLE in the ledger:
 *
 * - `flagged` — the meta agent's byte-verified row with an assigned cure. A member whose
 *   quote fails byte-verify can only leave the row by being NAMED in `droppedMembers`
 *   with its reason (never a silent exclusion); a row with any drop is DEGRADED, and may
 *   fall below two surviving instances — even to zero — because the drop list preserves
 *   the cluster's original member floor.
 * - `held-for-review` — the voters disagreed. Code builds this row directly from the
 *   validate checkpoint (no cure, no agent); `heldNote` points at that checkpoint's
 *   `voterVerdicts` as the triage surface. Because held rows are IN the ledger, an
 *   all-held audit renders as N held-marked rows and can never be mistaken for clean.
 *
