/**
 * Zod SSOT for the restatement-audit fleet (T3 sweep).
 *
 * @remarks
 * Mirrors `corpus-analysis/judgment-schemas.ts`'s atomic-judgment discipline: an LLM
 * finder emits one atomic, per-instance judgment (never a cross-file count or verdict);
 * deterministic code (`normalize.ts` / `join.ts`) groups instances by fact-key and
 * computes CONFLICT / LATENT; a voter judges one cluster against four conjunctive tests;
 * a meta agent resolves splits and assigns the fix. No agent ever emits a number that is
 * a function of more than one item it is also judging.
 *
 * Design authority: OCE's `resilient-wobbling-hartmanis.md` Deliverable 2 (the owner-approved
 * plan) and OCE's handoff `.agent/state/collaboration/handoffs/2026-07-16-audit-brief-team-mango.md`.
