 * invocation (tssecurity:S8707). A RELATIVE flag path resolves against the invocation
 * working directory (documented driver usage: the agent-tools workspace) before the
 * containment check. Shared by the post-run and salvage drivers — the boundary
 * behaviour (anchor, read, strict parse, typed failure) must be identical across both.
