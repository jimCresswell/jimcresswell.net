/**
 * Resolve which claimed corroboration homes genuinely exist on disk, anchored at the
 * repo root.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The meta stage claims repo-relative home paths (e.g. `.agent/rules/x.md`). Checking
 * them with a bare `existsSync` resolves against the process working directory — the
 * agent-tools workspace under the documented driver usage — so every real home reads
 * as missing. This helper anchors each claim at the supplied repo root instead, via
 * `assertPathWithinBase` exactly as the driver's checkpoint reads do (tssecurity:S8707
 * lineage): success proves the path both EXISTS (`realpathSync` throws on an absent
 * path) and stays CONTAINED within the repo root, so a claim that is absent or that
 * escapes the root is simply not corroborating — a discrepancy the caller surfaces,
 * never a crash.
 *
 * The returned set carries each claim's ORIGINAL path string, so downstream
 * set-membership against the claims themselves (`corroborateAgainstHomes`) matches.
 * Existence is canonicalisation-level: any on-disk entry (file or directory) counts,
 * matching the `existsSync` behaviour this replaces; claims are pipeline-internal
 * document paths from a committed, zod-validated checkpoint.
 *
 * @param input - The corroboration claims and the repo root to anchor them at.
 * @param options - The safe-path canonicalisation seam; tests inject a pure map.
 * @returns The claimed home paths that exist on disk within the repo root.
