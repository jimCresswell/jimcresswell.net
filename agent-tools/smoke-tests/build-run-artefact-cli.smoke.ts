 * partition file that lives OUTSIDE the repository is refused before it is read
 * or embedded in a launchable artefact (pull request #86 round two; the two
 * sibling drivers already read through the same helper). A missing file would
 * fail either way, so the smoke writes a real, valid partition under the
 * system temp directory and points the builder at it.
