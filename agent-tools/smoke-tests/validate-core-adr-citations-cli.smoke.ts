/**
 * CLI smoke for the Core ADR-citation gate's entry point: the validator runs
 * end to end over the live tracked tree (the Core listed, read as text and
 * scanned) and reports its green line on stdout, exit 0.
 *
 * What this smoke does not prove, and where it is proven instead:
 * - what reads as a citation, and where each is placed: the `findAdrCitations`
 *   and `findCoreCitations` cells.
 *
 * Observed by hand, not proven by any cell:
 * - the entry's exit 1, and its report, on a citation;
 * - the exit 2 refusals for zero tracked Core files and for a Core file that
 *   cannot be read as text.
