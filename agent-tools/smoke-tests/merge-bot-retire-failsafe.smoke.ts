 * runs a merged branch present on the remote, in the cache and locally, with
 * GitHub or git failing, or another writer moving a name, at one step, and
 * checks exit 1 and where every name is afterwards. No local name may go
 * unless the remote reads back absent; a name that moved after its proof is
 * kept and reported at the sha it moved to; a local delete that fails is
 * reported as failed, never as moved.
 *
 * Run by the smoke runner against real git, outside the test suite.
