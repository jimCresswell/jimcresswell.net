# Editorial Voice

Read and internalise `.agent/directives/editorial-guidance.md` before any content work. That document is the authoritative source — this skill adds practical guidance for applying it.

## The voice in one line

Confident, a touch joyful and mischievous, with underlying seriousness. Someone who knows exactly who they are.

## Two registers, one person

The front page and CV share the same voice but serve different purposes. A reader who encounters both should recognise the same person.

### CV register

- **Evidential.** Every sentence carries weight — it claims something or demonstrates something. No filler.
- **Precise and agentic.** "I conceived and built" not "my work has focused on." First-person, active, direct.
- **Claims-oriented.** The positioning makes abstract claims; the experience sections show them happening; the capabilities bridge both.
- **Scannable.** Hiring managers and recruiters are the primary readers. Significance should be visible on a first pass.

### Front page register

- **Narrative and reflective.** Storytelling register — "When I was young I wanted to understand space."
- **More expansive.** Room for personal interests, values, philosophical threads.
- **Openly emotional.** "Fell in love with the open web" works here; it would not land the same way on the CV.
- **Invitational.** Ends with openness — "I am always excited to discuss where others see the levers."

### Overlap

Both registers share: cosmology, published research, the open web, ecology, systems thinking, AI for public benefit. Where a concept appears in both, framing must be consistent — same person, different context.

## Common pitfalls

These were discovered through editorial sessions. They are the most frequent ways the voice goes wrong.

### Justification

The most common failure mode. Justification explains _why_ Jim did something, as if the reader needs convincing. A confident person states what they did and what it creates.

| Justification (wrong)                                 | Confident intent (right)                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I built these tools to lower the cost of innovation" | "These tools lower the cost of innovation for everyone"        |
| "The intent is deliberately indirect, reflecting..."  | Just describe what the work does and what it makes possible    |
| "I backed a rebuild because..."                       | "I backed a rebuild, accepting and managing near-term risk..." |

If a sentence explains _why_, rewrite it to state _what_ and _what it creates_. The reader who understands the positioning will recognise the pattern.

### Passive and descriptive framing

| Passive (wrong)                                  | Agentic (right)                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| "My work has focused on treating X as..."        | "I conceived and built X..."              |
| "This has included exposing it through..."       | "I designed and delivered..."             |
| "Contributes to infrastructure that supports..." | "I create infrastructure that enables..." |

### Tell sentences

If the preceding paragraphs already demonstrate something, do not add a sentence summarising it. Trust the narrative to carry its own weight.

### Hedging

| Hedged (wrong)                                                   | Direct (right)                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Enabling durable, ethical, and high-impact solutions to emerge" | "Giving teams a clear frame to build against with confidence"                 |
| "Instincts that now underpin my exploratory leadership"          | Show the instincts in action — describe a moment where they produced a result |

### Unclear abstractions

Words like "ecosystem" should be replaced with what they actually mean: systems, context, and creating the conditions for new states to emerge. If a word could mean anything, it means nothing.

## The check

After writing or editing content, ask:

1. Does this sound like someone who knows exactly who they are?
2. Would Jim say this out loud, confidently, to someone he respects?
3. Is every sentence showing or claiming — never explaining or justifying?
4. Does a reader who saw the front page and then the CV recognise the same person?
5. Does the implicit reading test hold — does a reader finish thinking "this person could found something serious if they chose to"?
