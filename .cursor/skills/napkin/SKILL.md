# Napkin

Maintain a per-repo markdown file that tracks mistakes, corrections,
and patterns that work or don't. Read it before doing anything and
update it continuously as you work.

**This skill is always active. Every session. No trigger required.**

## Session Start: Read Your Notes

First thing, every session — read both files before doing anything:

1. **`.agent/memory/distilled.md`** — Curated rules, patterns,
   and troubleshooting. This is the high-signal reference.
   Internalise and apply silently.
2. **`.agent/memory/napkin.md`** — Recent session log. Scan for
   context from the most recent sessions.

If neither file exists, create `napkin.md` at
`.agent/memory/napkin.md` with a session heading and start
logging. The [distillation skill](../distillation/SKILL.md)
handles creating `distilled.md` at rotation time.

## Continuous Updates

Update the napkin as you work, not just at session start and
end. Write to it whenever you learn something worth recording:

- **You hit an error and figure out why.** Log it immediately.
- **The user corrects you.** Log what you did and what they
  wanted instead.
- **You catch your own mistake.** Log it. Your mistakes count
  the same as user corrections — maybe more.
- **You try something and it fails.** Log the approach and why.
- **You try something and it works well.** Log the pattern.
- **You re-read the napkin mid-task** because you are about to
  do something you have gotten wrong before. Good. Do this.

## What to Log

Log anything that would change your behaviour if you read it
next session:

- **Your own mistakes**: wrong assumptions, bad approaches,
  misread code, failed commands, incorrect fixes.
- **User corrections**: anything the user told you to do
  differently.
- **Tool/environment surprises**: things about this repo, its
  tooling, or its patterns that you did not expect.
- **Preferences**: how the user likes things done.
- **What worked**: approaches that succeeded, especially
  non-obvious ones.

Be specific. "Made an error" is useless. "Assumed the API
returns a list but it returns a paginated object with `.items`"
is actionable.

## Napkin Structure

Each session gets a heading and subsections:

```markdown
## Session: YYYY-MM-DD — Brief Title

### What Was Done

- (summary of work completed)

### Patterns to Remember

- (actionable insights from this session)
```

Add `### Mistakes Made` or `### Fixes` subsections as needed.

## Rotation

When the napkin exceeds ~500 lines, follow the
[distillation skill](../distillation/SKILL.md) to extract
high-signal content into `distilled.md`, archive the napkin,
and start fresh.

## Example

**Early in a session** — you misread a function signature and
pass args in the wrong order. You catch it yourself. Log it
under "Patterns to Remember":

- `createUser(id, name)` not `createUser(name, id)` — this
  codebase does not follow conventional arg ordering

**Mid-session** — user corrects your import style. Log it:

- This repo uses absolute imports from `src/` — always

**Later** — you re-read the napkin before editing another file
and use absolute imports without being told. That is the loop
working.
