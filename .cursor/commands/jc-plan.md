# Create a Plan

All plans, prompts, and work must be fully aligned with the foundation docs @.agent/directives/rules.md and @.agent/directives/testing-strategy.md . All sub-sections must have goals and intended impacts, and explicit, measurable acceptance criteria.

All code must be documented with comprehensive TSDoc comments. Authored markdown documentation (READMEs) must be created as appropriate.

Use the provided details to create a plan that is fully aligned with the foundation docs. If no details were provided, or the details are not clear, ask the user for more details — ask specific questions to clarify.
